  abstract = {Background: Integrating computational thinking (CT) into STEM education has recently drawn significant attention, strengthened by the premise that CT and STEM are mutually reinforcing. Previous CT-STEM studies have examined theoretical interpretations, instructional strategies, and assessment targets. However, few have endeavored to delineate the transfer effects of CT-STEM on the development of cognitive and noncognitive benefits. Given this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to provide deeper insights. Results: We analyzed results from 37 studies involving 7,832 students with 96 effect sizes. Our key findings include: (i) identification of 36 benefits; (ii) a moderate overall transfer effect, with moderate effects also observed for both near and far transfers; (iii) a stronger effect on cognitive benefits compared to noncognitive benefits, regardless of the transfer type; (iv) significant moderation by educational level, sample size, instructional strategies, and intervention duration on overall and near-transfer effects, with only educational level and sample size being significant moderators for far-transfer effects. Conclusions: This study analyzes the cognitive and noncognitive benefits arising from CT-STEM’s transfer effects, providing new insights to foster more effective STEM classroom teaching. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {Addressing cognitive disparities has become a paramount concern in computational thinking (CT) education. The intricate and nuanced relationships between CT and cognitive variations emphasize the needs to accommodate diverse cognitive profiles when fostering CT skills, recognizing that these cognitive functions can manifest as either strengths or limitations in different students. Consequently, understanding the connections between students’ cognitive functions and CT skills assumes pivotal importance in the design of personalized instructional strategies for CT. Despite a general consideration of learning variability in CT education, empirical insights exploring the correlation between cognitive skills and CT competencies remain notably scarce. This study endeavors to bridge this research gap by investigating the links between executive functions and CT skills, as well as the associations between their sub-dimensions. The results reveal a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.452 between these two domains, underscoring the notable connection between executive functions and CT abilities. Furthermore, the sub-dimensional analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of how specific executive functions uniquely contribute to certain CT skills. In light of these findings, this research offers a promising pathway for the development of tailored CT education programs that can cater to the unique needs of each individual, ultimately facilitating inclusive CT programs and making significant contributions to broaden STEM education and future workforce. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

This study seeks to fill this gap by employing gamified CT items across multiple difficulty levels to calculate comprehensive behavioral sequence quality indicators. And then, through latent profile analysis, we identified four distinct latent classes of behavioral process. We then examined the in-game performance differences among these classes, uncovering each class’s unique attributes. Class 1 students consistently demonstrated high-quality, efficient behavioral sequences regardless of item difficulty. In contrast, class 2 students applied significant cognitive effort and trial-and-error strategies, achieving acceptable scores despite low behavioral sequence quality. Class 3 students excelled in simpler items but faltered with more complex ones. Class 4 students displayed low motivation for challenging items, often guessing answers quickly. Additionally, we investigated the predictive value of students’ performance in gamified items and their behavioral process classes for their external CT test scores.

Although many reviews have provided synthesized information on CT teaching and learning, few have paid particular attention to collaborative learning (CL) strategies. CL has been widely implemented in CT classes and has become the most popular pedagogy among educators. Therefore, a systematic review of CL in CT classes would provide practical guidance on teaching strategies to enhance CT interventions and improve the quality of teaching and learning, ultimately benefiting students’ CT skills development. To address this gap, this study examined 43 empirical studies that have applied CL strategies, ranging from 2006 to 2022. Several findings were revealed in the analysis. First, a wide range of theories and frameworks were applied to inform research questions, pedagogical design, and research methodologies. Second, despite the acknowledged importance of group composition in effective CL, a large number of studies did not provide details on how the students were grouped. Third, six types of CL activities and instructional designs have been identified in CT classrooms. The synthesized information provides valuable insights that can inform future research directions and guide the design and implementation of CL activities in future CT classes. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

A total of 98 in-service and pre-service teachers who participated in a robotics teaching professional development workshop served as the sample of the study. A survey including the Computational Thinking Scale, the Design Thinking Disposition Scale, the Robotics Teaching Beliefs Scale and the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge–Robotics Scale was conducted after the workshop. A confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the measurement constructs, and Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was utilized to examine the relationships among the factors. The results revealed that both CT and DT dispositions could positively predict teachers’ robotics teaching beliefs, which subsequently predicted their RPCK. Moreover, a direct positive relationship between CT and RPCK was identified, while such a relationship was not evident for DT. The model demonstrates the critical role of CT in shaping teachers' beliefs and pedagogical strategies of robotics teaching, and provides insights into the indirect influence of DT. Finally, the Model of Robotics Teaching Professional Development (MRTPD) was proposed to profile how to promote teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge of robotics teaching from their CT and DT dispositions. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies that have integrated AI and CT for student development. We collected 18 papers from four prominent research databases in the fields of education and AI technology: Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and ACM. We coded the collected studies, highlighting the students’ learning processes in terms of research methodology and context, learning tools and instructional design, student learning outcomes, and the interaction between AI and CT. The integration of AI and CT occurs in two ways: the integration of disciplinary knowledge and leveraging AI tools to learn CT. Specifically, we discovered that AI- and CT-related tools, projects, and problems facilitated student-centered instructional designs, resulting in productive AI and CT learning outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  year = {2024}},
  journal = {International Journal of STEM Education}},
  abstract = {Background: Computational thinking (CT) is crucial to fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Many elementary schools have been cultivating students’ CT through block-based programming languages such as Scratch using traditional teacher-centered teaching methods. However, the approach excessively relies on teacher lectures, so the teacher’s teaching load is hefty, and most students cannot receive timely assistance from teachers, thus reducing students’ programming learning performance, interest, and confidence. Therefore, this study designs a Jigsaw collaborative learning method implemented in a metaverse virtual space (JCLM-MVS) for peer-to-peer Scratch programming learning to promote learners’ programming learning performance, CT, and learning attitudes. This study used a quasi-experimental research method, with 48 fifth-grade students from two classes in Taiwan’s elementary school as the research participants. One class of 24 students was randomly assigned to the experimental group using JCLM-MVS to conduct Scratch programming learning, whereas the other class of 24 students was assigned to the control group using the traditional teacher-centered teaching method. Main findings: The study found that the experimental group of learners showed significantly better Scratch programming learning performance and attitude than the control group, and there was no statistically significant difference in CT between both groups, but both learning approaches effectively promoted CT. Additionally, the interview results showed that most interviewees stated that using JCLM-MVS for Scratch programming learning could receive timely assistance from peers, make collaborative learning more efficient and learning more enjoyable, and more intend to use JCLM-MVS for Scratch programming learning than using traditional teacher-centered teaching method due to the effective collaborative interaction mechanisms and realistic learning space provided in the metaverse virtual space. Conclusions/potential implications: This study presents a novel and engaging learning approach by integrating a metaverse virtual space with the Jigsaw collaborative learning method, referred to as JCLM-MVS, which enhances the effectiveness of the Jigsaw collaborative learning method in promoting Scratch programming learning performance, CT, and attitudes. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {This study employs meta-analysis to synthesize findings from 30 articles investigating gender differences in computational thinking (CT) among K-12 students. Encompassing 51 independent effect sizes, the meta-analysis involves a participant pool of 9181 individuals from various countries, comprising 4254 males and 4927 females. Results indicate statistically significant gender differences in CT (Hedges’s g = 0.091, p <.05), albeit with a modest effect size, revealing higher CT scores among males compared to females. Further moderation analyses unveil the multifaceted nature of these gender differences. Specifically, while gender differences become significant during high school, recent studies suggest a gradual reduction in CT gender differences with societal progress among K-12 students. Moreover, findings illustrate variations in gender differences across geographical regions. Notably, while the overall gender disparity in CT is non-significant in the “East Asia and Pacific” region, it widens in “North America” and “Europe”, with males scoring higher than females. Conversely, in “Europe and Central Asia”, such gender differences present inconsistent outcomes, with females scoring higher than males. Importantly, assessment tool type does not significantly influence gender differences. Lastly, this study offers recommendations to address CT gender gaps, providing valuable insights for promoting gender equality in education. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to address two main objectives: (a) the effectiveness of empirical interventions on the development of CT in children aged of 3–8 years; and (b) the variables that influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Following PRISMA procedures, we identified 17 empirical studies with 34 effect sizes and 1665 participants meeting the inclusion criteria from Web of Science database. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (d =.83 [95% CI: 730,.890]; p <.001) on the CT development of 3–8 years old children, which provides empirical support for having young children to engage in CT experiences. The effect size was significantly influenced by moderating variables including gender, scaffolding, and education level. Intervention length showed a marginally significant effect. Therefore, educators could refer to the significant moderators when designing tailored interventions for CT development in early childhood education while a call for more empirical studies of CT development in young children is proposed. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

Although previous research has highlighted potentials of applying educational robotics in STEM education, there is a lack of empirical evidence to investigate and understand the overall effects of using educational robotics in STEM education as well as the critical factors that influence the effects. To fill this gap, this research conducted a multilevel meta-analysis to examine the overall effect size of using educational robotics in STEM education under K-16 education based on 30 effect sizes from 21 studies published between 2010 and 2022. Furthermore, we examined the possible moderator variables of robot-assisted STEM education, including discipline, educational level, instructor support, instructional strategy, interactive type, intervention duration, robotic type, and control group condition. Results showed that educational robotics had the moderate-sized effects on students’ STEM learning compared to the non-robotics condition. Specifically, educational robotics had moderate-sized effects on students’ learning performances and learning attitudes, and insignificant effects on the improvement of computational thinking. Furthermore, we examined the influence of moderator variables in robot-assisted STEM education. Results indicated that the moderator variable of discipline was significantly associated with the effects of educational robotics on STEM learning. Based on the findings, educational and technological implications were provided to guide future research and practice in the application of educational robotics in STEM education. © 2024, The Author(s).}},

We have found that integrating an Adaptive Learning Strategy with diverse didactic techniques gives better results. The objectives of this exploratory study were to know the impact of the Adaptive Learning Strategy on students’ learning and achievement of disciplinary and transversal sub-competencies in courses supported by an Adaptive Platform in the School of Engineering and Sciences at Tecnologico de Monterrey. The assessment of the students’ and professors’ experience with an Adaptive Learning Strategy evaluated platform’s usability, teaching, learning, and engagement. The study employed a mixed methodological approach, sequential Quant- > Qual, and was quasi-experimental, with control and experimental groups. The courses that participated in the intervention were Computational Thinking, Physics I, Physics II, and Fundamental Mathematical Modeling. The findings indicated that implementing an innovation like Adaptive Learning positively impacts students’ learning and improvement when integrating elements of a flipped classroom, self-regulated learning, and micro-learning into an Adaptive Learning Strategy.

Moderator analyses revealed which interventions were effective, in which situations, and for what kind of learner. A significant overall mean effect of debugging interventions ((Formula presented.) = 0.64, CI = (0.32, 0.96), p <.001), was found based on 62 effect sizes from 18 source articles. Significant between-studies variation indicated that true effects could range from −0.54 to 1.82. In addition, sensitivity analyses and checks on confounding provided further understandings of intervention features and their impacts. Interventions using enhanced debuggers and systematic instruction were particularly effective in fostering debugging skills. Debugging intervention effects varied by participant population and potentially by publication type. Moreover, debugging interventions had impact regardless of how debugging skills were measured, programming medium used, control-group type, and whether the study was randomized. Future studies should investigate the best practices for improving debugging abilities for whom and under what circumstances. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {Algebraic laws of functions in mathematics - such as commutativity, associativity, and idempotence - are often used as the basis to derive more sophisticated properties of complex mathematical structures and are heavily used in abstract computational thinking. Algebraic laws of functions in coding, however, are rarely considered. Yet, they are essential. For example, commutativity and associativity are crucial to ensure correctness of a variety of software systems in numerous domains, such as compiler optimization, big data processing, data flow processing, machine learning or distributed algorithms and data structures. Still, most programming languages lack built-in mechanisms to enforce and verify that operations adhere to such properties. In this paper, we propose a verifier specialized on a set of fundamental algebraic laws that ensures that such laws hold in application code. The verifier can conjecture auxiliary properties and can reason about both equalities and inequalities of expressions, which is crucial to prove a given property when other competitors do not succeed. We implement these ideas in the Propel verifier. Our evaluation against five state-of-the-art verifiers on a total of 142 instances of algebraic properties shows that Propel is able to automatically deduce algebraic properties in different domains that rely on such properties for correctness, even in cases where competitors fail to verify the same properties or time out.  © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

Coding tools like robotic toys and tablet apps have become popular in early childhood education to support CT development, but there is a debate on which tool is more effective. Little evidence exists on the effect of coding on children’s Social-Emotional Competence (SEC), which is crucial for lifelong development and extends beyond cognitive development. This experimental study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two 9-week programs on promoting 73 preschool children’s CT and SEC, one using coding robots and the other using coding apps. The results showed that children who participated in the Coding Robot Program had higher CT scores than those in the Coding App Program, after controlling for age, gender, family socioeconomic status, and baseline CT scores. While the SEC scores showed no substantial disparities between the groups, it was revealed that the initial performance levels moderated the intervention effects on emotional regulation and overall SEC. This suggests that the Coding Robot Program could be especially advantageous for a subset of children who initially have difficulties with emotional regulation and social skills.

For instance, Parsons Problems have emerged as one of the preferred scaffolding strategies to help CS1 students get a grasp on programming before being exposed to open write-code assignments. However, prior literature has not given enough attention to those students who fail CS1 and must retake the course.

In this version of the course, although students were already introduced to computational thinking, program design, and coding (as they were taking CS1 for a second time), it was the first time they were exposed to Parsons Problems. We conducted a follow-up assessment of the students' perceptions throughout the course, employing a combination of focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and end-course surveys. Our results suggest that Parsons Problems are effective for learners beyond the ''novice programmer'' stage (such as the experience of CS1 retakers), highlighting good practices to support the studied group in terms of engagement, performance, and overall student experience. © 2024 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Design thinking (DT) and computational activities foster children's knowledge capital for 21st-century literacies. The analysis of these activities often overlooks affective and behavioural states despite their significance in providing insights into children's learning processes. Typically, these states and their changes are self-reported, lacking real-time capturing. Moreover, inquiries via Multi-Modal Data (MMD) for more comprehensive views are underrepresented in the current literature. We, therefore, conducted a DT activity focusing on coding engaging 33 children (aged 10 to 12) and analysed measurements including learning gain (from knowledge tests) and behavioural and affective states (from physiological sensors, video and voice recordings). Our results show that engagement and confusion exhibit positive correlations between MMD measurements and learning gain, while stress, frustration and anger stand out as detrimental for it. By mapping transitions in states experienced by the children, we unravelled negative learning scenarios that should be limited, along with positive indicators of increased performance. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Programming courses can be challenging for first year university students, especially for those without prior coding experience. Students initially struggle with code syntax, but as more advanced topics are introduced across a semester, the difficulty in learning to program shifts to learning computational thinking (e.g., debugging strategies). This study examined the relationships between students' rate of programming errors and their grades on two exams. Using an online integrated development environment, data were collected from 280 students in a Java programming course. The course had two parts. The first focused on introductory procedural programming and culminated with exam 1, while the second part covered more complex topics and object-oriented programming and ended with exam 2. To measure students' programming abilities, 51095 code snapshots were collected from students while they completed assignments that were autograded based on unit tests. Compiler and runtime errors were extracted from the snapshots, and three measures - Error Count, Error Quotient and Repeated Error Density - were explored to identify the best measure explaining variability in exam grades. Models utilizing Error Quotient outperformed the models using the other two measures, in terms of the explained variability in grades and Bayesian Information Criterion. Compiler errors were significant predictors of exam 1 grades but not exam 2 grades; only runtime errors significantly predicted exam 2 grades. The findings indicate that leveraging Error Quotient with multiple error types (compiler and runtime) may be a better measure of students' introductory programming abilities, though still not explaining most of the observed variability. © 2024 ACM.}},

  abstract = {With the growing demand for computational skills in the job market, it’s imperative that lower secondary school students grasp basic programming concepts such as repetition, modularity, conditionals, and variables. Yet, many students perceive computer science as daunting and irrelevant. Physical computing offers a promising solution to this motivational gap. It enhances intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes towards technology. Moreover, they engage students who may not identify as typical programmers and foster essential computational thinking skills. This research investigates the efficacy of employing the same educational robot in different contexts, such as music, images, colors, and simple video games, while teaching basic programming concepts. We call this approach “multi-context physical computing” to emphasize the focus on the different application scenarios. We believe that this could benefit students for two reasons. Firstly, by presenting the same concept across different contexts, learners can better grasp the essence of the concept, disentangling it from extraneous contextual associations. Secondly, catering to individual interests by offering diverse contexts may enhance motivation, consequently fostering improved learning outcomes, as predicted by the expectancy-value theory. In order to assess the benefits of the multi-context approach on learning outcomes and motivation, we will compare it to a more traditional single-context approach centered on robot locomotion in a randomized controlled study. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)}},

  abstract = {The premise for the development of the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course was aimed at broadening participation in computing, as a high school level CS course. Since AP courses carry credibility with millions of students who take AP Exams as they are recognized with prospects of obtaining a college education, the hope was that the AP CS Principles course would lead to increased participation in AP CS Exams, especially with students historically excluded in CS including girls, Black, Hispanic, and Native American students, as well those with disabilities. The course raises opportunities and access to CS in higher education. The AP CS Principles curriculum framework is used in the development of the Exam which is significant in the creation college credit and placement policies. Nearly 1,300 colleges and universities have created policies providing students with opportunities to receive college credit or placement for scoring a 3 or higher on the AP CS Principles Exam [12]. The AP CS Principles curriculum framework is also used to define the learning outcomes for the course and stands as a pivotal tool in shaping high school CS education pathways to post-secondary introductory CS courses: It was designed to meet rigorous content requirements of an innovative first semester college-level introductory CS course. It exposes students to demanding expectations of building high levels of computational thinking skills and practical applications of programming that are valuable as they advance in their academics. It provides opportunities for students to connect fundamental programming concepts with important topics such as understanding the role of data in programming, and how data is processed and analyzed. AP CS Principles also recognizes the societal impacts of technology and teaches students about ethical considerations that may arise when analyzing bias in technological systems so that students develop a well-rounded perspective on technology's role in society [5]. Additional themes such as the infrastructure of the Internet including networks and protocols are also included. This paper focuses on the vision of the AP CS Principles course underpinnings (a) being engaging and appealing to a wider range of students, (b) making it accessible for a more racially, ethnically, and gender-identity diverse population of high school students, and (c) providing the benefits of the AP label on students' high school transcripts gives them options to consider a pathway into college CS studies with an enhanced admissions appeal, potential academic scholarships, and/or careers in the field. We investigate the structure of the AP CS Principles curriculum framework as a key resource that impacts the kinds of teaching and learning that is promoted in the Course and Exam Description. We discuss our experiences with the imbalanced emphasis on inclusive pedagogy and building community within the classroom to directly increase sense of belonging with students historically excluded from computing. Lastly, while the AP CS Principles Exam continues to flourish in participation numbers, we question the effectiveness of policies to promote broadening participation in computing. We review policies from three different states and discuss how they leverage the AP CS Principles course to promote teacher certification and student enrollment but do not necessarily ensure equitable practices to promote diverse representation in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic background, and disability.  © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), as a new future-oriented literacy, has gained attention at the basic education level. Graphical programming is the common way to develop CT in primary students, but this drag-and-drop programming may weaken students’ understanding of programming’s abstract concepts and code logic. Text-based programming approaches can solve the problems faced by graphical programming, but few studies have explored the impact of text-based programming on CT. Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 98 6th graders to explore the impact of gamified Python programming on CT. The findings showed that CT skills, as well as abstraction and decomposition, pattern recognition and evaluation in CT sub-skills, were significantly higher with students in the experimental group than in the control group. Furthermore, we found that gamified Python programming enabled boys and girls to reach the same level of CT skills. However, in terms of CT sub-skills, we found that gamified Python programming was more beneficial to the development of pattern recognition and evaluation skills for boys and abstraction and decomposition skills for girls. This demonstrated the effectiveness of gamified Python programming to improve primary students’ CT skills while clarifying the impact of gender and enriching research in the field of text-based programming. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  abstract = {In an age of rapid technological development, primary schools now teach programming to young students, focusing on developing their computational thinking, problem-solving, and ability to use computers to create solutions. However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python. This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment. Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems}},
  abstract = {In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-The-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

For three years, the RPP has been exploring ways to strengthen computational thinking within elementary math and science instruction, attending to policy considerations and the local education landscape. The RPP is motivated in part by the hypothesis that a larger, more diverse group of students will choose to enroll in computer science courses in high school if they gain familiarity and confidence related to computational concepts at earlier grades.

  abstract = {This study introduces the Concrete Computational Concepts Programming Environments (3CPEs), an innovative approach designed to help elementary students grasp abstract computational concepts through concrete metaphors using tangible and everyday objects. Traditional programming environments for children focus on concrete programming language syntax and semantics yet often fall short in conveying advanced computational concepts. To address this gap, 3CPEs combine the hands-on appeal of computer-science unplugged activities with the versatility of programming environments, using familiar objects and gamified elements to visualize abstract computational and algorithmic ideas. An example is CT (Computational Thinking) Chef, a 3CPEs implementation to enhance elementary students' understanding of programming concepts. Through design workshops with five elementary programming teachers, we preliminarily identified teaching challenges and evaluated 3CPEs' efficacy as an educational tool. The feedback underscores CT Chef's potential in facilitating the teaching of intricate computational concepts for young learners. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate biological functions by interacting with specific RNAs, and play an important role in many life activities. Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance. Physicochemical properties can be used to supplement characterization information to improving model performance. The experimental results show that MAHyNet has better performance than other models.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.}},

However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices. This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys. Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

Most district students are part of historically marginalized groups and the RPP chose to develop an equity and inclusion-focused curriculum that would be taught in all elementary classrooms to all students. Twelve teacher teams, supported by researchers and ELL and SPED specialists, designed, piloted, and documented 23 modules of 4-8, 45-minute lessons across K-5. Early adopter teachers followed the pilots and implemented the modules in their classrooms with the goal of facilitating adoption by all elementary classroom teachers. After being interrupted by the pandemic, the RPP developed a strategy where principals in cohorts of schools agreed to collaborate with RPP school-based lead teachers to establish professional learning communities (PLCs) to support classroom implementation of the modules. Eleven schools participated in a 2021-22 cohort and nine more schools joined in 2022-23. Centering equity, PLCs, and quality module documentation and materials are key to sustaining and evolving the CSforAll curriculum. The modules were revised based on feedback obtained from ELL and SPED specialists, early adopters, teacher coordinators, researchers, and district curriculum directors. Using a large data set of meeting and classroom observation records, interviews, field notes, focus groups, surveys, and module documentation, we track the evolution of the curriculum and provide a detailed analysis of one module as an example. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

However, there is a lack of research on practice-based assignments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) projects, that allow undergraduate students to design and demonstrate educational robots using digital or physical assistance, especially when it comes to computational thinking (CT) and programming skills development in association with their psycho-emotional experience.

A quasi-experimental approach was conducted, involving two hundred forty-six participants (n = 246), who were equally divided between Scratch and LEGO® WeDo groups. Results indicate that the LEGO® WeDo group showed greater improvement in CT and programming skills development, while designing and presenting IoT projects. Nevertheless, no significant association between motivation, grit, and CT skills was observed. The findings highlight the potential of tangible robotics in facilitating students’ hands-on learning and enhancing motivation to foster CT and programming skills.

Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

After the audio files were transcribed, 1,303 conversations were obtained. They were analyzed via Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) Webkit, which can reveal the trajectory of students’ CT development via analyzing codes of discourse related to CT in PP. Three Scratch learning topics were assessed based on the Dr. Scratch platform to acquire the level of students’ CT and to determine the low- and high-scoring groups. Results indicated that CT concepts and CT practices were always closely related in PP and CT practices, and CT perspectives could be gradually and closely related after a long period of CT training. A significant difference between the two groups’ CT structures was found. The high-scoring group had more fragments of CT practice and connecting of CT perspectives, while the low-scoring group showed more fragments of CT concepts and expressing of CT perspectives. This research provides insights into cultivating primary school students’ CT using Scratch in the context of PP. The findings can provide suggestions for instructors to design instructional interventions to facilitate students’ CT skills via PP learning. Instructors can improve CT skills by guiding students to constantly ask questions, and specifying the role swap between driver and navigator in PP. Besides, instructors could give more consideration to the development of CT perspectives, and especially the ability to question. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool.

This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops.

  abstract = {How to measure students' Computational Problem-Solving (CPS) competencies is an ongoing research topic. Prevalent approaches vary by measurement tools (e.g., interactive programming, multiple-choice tests, or programming-independent tests) and task types (e.g., debugging problems or Parson problems). However, few studies have examined the measurement tools of CPS competencies themselves: affordances and limitations of the measurement tools and how they compare, or whether different task types might elicit CPS competencies differently. Research needs to address these questions in order to better understand how to design robust, generalizable, and effective measurement tools for CPS competencies. This paper presents an exploratory study that contributes to this research direction. It is part of a larger international project to develop an open-access formative assessment platform for CPS, which includes a novel authoring tool for a wide range of task types for interactive block-based programming. We used the tool to create an interactive programming experience with multiple task types and gave it to more than 300 secondary school students from different countries. We also administered a validated multiple-choice measurement of Computational Thinking with block-based programs. We focused on task complexity as a characteristic of task type, using a classification scheme based on task design features. Comparing students' performances on tasks of different complexity and using two distinct measurement tools, we found that the multiple-choice measurement only partially predicts performance in the interactive programming task. Additionally, its predictive capacity varies significantly between task types of differing complexity. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {The Idaho Elementary Computer Science (CS) Collaborative (IECC) is a researcher-practitioner partnership dedicated to understanding how to better support the predominately rural districts in Idaho to implement elementary CS education. As part of the IECC's work, we conducted a survey of elementary teachers across the state. This poster will present our initial findings. Two of the research questions we addressed via the survey are: (1) What factors would motivate Idaho elementary teachers to pursue professional development (PD) related to CS? (2) What are elementary teachers' perceptions of the value of connecting CS education to rural community economies and industries? Descriptive analyses of 309 survey responses suggest that about three-quarters of elementary teachers reported that the following factors would be at least somewhat influential in their decisions to pursue CS PD: a K-5 computational thinking requirement, a district-wide CS planning staff, a pathway for elementary teachers to earn a certification in CS teaching, and a way to request CS PD funding. Few (9%) Idaho elementary teachers found that the perception of a disconnect between CS education and rural community interests was a significant barrier to elementary CS education. Even so, over 70% of them were moderately to strongly interested in mechanisms for connecting their CS education efforts to rural community industries through guest speakers and industry partnerships. The poster will discuss the implications of these and other emerging findings from the teacher survey, as well as IECC's related surveys of Idaho district superintendents and elementary school principals. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15% and 78% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.  © 2024 ACM.}},

Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation.

A consistent challenge reported in these initiatives is teaching abstraction. This position paper offers preliminary recommendations for abstraction pedagogy in elementary education. These suggestions stem from an analysis of unplugged abstraction examples showcased during a summer institute on computational thinking. By examining commonalities among abstraction examples, key parts of the process of abstraction pertinent to elementary classrooms were identified: (1) the abstraction process is typically performed in reverse since students in elementary school are given abstractions to start with; (2) evaluation of concrete details to support an abstraction is part of the filtering step of abstraction; (3) in the absence of evaluation criteria, pattern recognition can be applied to a set of concrete examples to extract characteristics of an abstraction; and (4) abstractions can be supported by not only concrete details but other abstractions which students will need to develop an understanding of before fully comprehending the initial concept. Preliminary recommendations for abstraction instruction include having students evaluate examples; engaging students in pattern recognition to extract characteristics of an abstraction; developing student fluency in describing abstractions, their supporting examples, and characteristics; and assessing students by asking not only for examples of abstractions, but for their characteristics as well.  © 2024 ACM.}},

To address this research gap, this study analyses the participants’ thinking processes in solving programming-based mathematical problems from a flexibility perspective, focusing on the interplay between computational and mathematical thinking, that is, how CT and MT work together to influence and determine the problem-solver’s choice of solution strategy. Using data collected from a large design-based study, we summarise two types of flexibility and six subtypes of flexibility demonstrated by participants in the programming-based mathematical problem-solving process using thematic analysis. These different types of flexibility provide researchers and mathematics educators with new theoretical perspectives to examine the interplay of CT and MT. Findings will also contribute toward student learning characteristics in programming-based mathematical problem-solving to sketch the big picture of how CT and MT emerge in complementary or mismatching ways. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  abstract = {In our modern society, technology has profoundly reshaped various aspects of our lives, influencing the way we work, communicate, and interact. This raises a fundamental question: Is the current K-12 education system adequately preparing students for success in this technology-driven era, where innovation and problem-solving skills are essential? A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences. In summary, the study outlines a trajectory where students and educators skillfully navigate the complexities of contemporary paradigms. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.  © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press.}},

This qualitative cross-case study examined the barriers and strengths three exemplar teachers faced, explored the supports and resources they provided, and presented how these teachers defined successful inclusive CS learning outcomes for their students. The data set included analysis of the semistructured teachers' interviews and teaching materials. The results included seven successful strategies the teachers identified: 1) using physical computing, 2) pair programming, 3)connecting CS and Individual Education Plans (IEP), 4)applying hands-on activities, 5) CT integration, 6) using CS vocabulary, and 7)open-ended pedagogy. Three resources and supports the teacher provided emerged from the data set as follows: 1) accessible instructional materials, 2) projects with multiple entry points, and 3) essential scaffolding supports. Whereas four barriers teachers faced; 1. subject matter, 2) accessible tools, 3) students receiving support, 3) the role of CS in instruction, and 4) the role of time served as additional findings. The results suggested that school-based practitioners, including administrators, can overcome the barriers and promote successful strategies that lead to asset-based CS-inclusion in the classroom. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Computing and computing concepts are interconnected with virtually every aspect of daily life and every field of study. However, when teaching new computing concepts to novice programmers, the number of example domain applications that can be presented is extremely limited. In addition, programming assignments where students apply these concepts are typically closed-ended, fully defining the problem to be solved. As a result, there are few opportunities for students to take an active role in creating connections between computing concepts and situations where they can be applied. See Logic in Life exercises are short, non-programming exercises comprised of a logical and a visual component. The exercise format provides opportunities for students to explore and create their own connections between computing concepts and application domains. Further, by sharing these connections with fellow classmates, students are exposed to a breadth of applications for a given concept via a peer learning experience. Student feedback on the impacts of both creating and sharing computing connections via See Logic in Life exercises is presented.

This has led to critical analyses that reveal the inequitable conditions that children of color face in CS education. Intersectionality has also supported curricular innovations and interventions that aim to make CS education more equitable by being responsive to children's identities and communities. However, the concept of class has received less attention than race and gender by culturally responsive computing scholars who draw on intersectionality in their CS education research. How might class fit into intersectional research and theory in culturally responsive computing scholarship? The objective of this paper is to answer this question with a proof-of-concept study that tests the feasibility of what we call worker-driven computing education. We introduce findings from our research and collaborations with current, once, and retired autoworkers in Detroit, Michigan to define the computational thinking idea of automation from their perspectives. Through analyzing qualitative data, a worker-driven definition of automation was developed by drawing on autoworker-expertise about the points of production in the auto-industry.

The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

Designing a required CS course that meets the needs of anticipated future advancements in the field necessitates exploring the research question, What computing content do high school teachers, college instructors, and computing industry professionals prioritize in a required computer science course for high school students? To better understand what these different groups perceive to be the essential content of a foundational high school CS course, we conducted a series of focus groups. These focus groups explored participants' (n = 21) thinking about what content would be most important to prioritize in a required high school CS course. Transcripts of the focus groups were abductively coded and then analyzed to determine what CS content priorities were identified and what disagreements about priorities exist. We found that participants (1) emphasized CS knowledge and skills, with minimal reference to dispositions, (2) prioritized content similar to that found in current CS standards, (3) developed broad, high-level descriptions of content, (4) identified contextually relevant factors, (5) foregrounded AI both a tool and as a subdomain of CS, and (6) emphasized computational thinking. These findings can inform further research on the design and implementation of a required high school CS course designed to meet the needs of the future as well as to support revisions of CS standards for high school students. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

This landscape evaluation represents the baseline start of a wider, four-year national study around district capacity to collaboratively develop consistent and comprehensive K-12 computing pathways for their students and schools. The early landscape work we present here not only represents a starting point for comparing district educators' comprehension of CT (and computer science [CS]), but also acts as an early indicator as to what extent K-12 computing is a school and district-based priority, and to what degree teachers feel they have the capacity to meaningfully implement it. This poster relies on two data sources in a mixed-methods design: Districtwide surveys of teachers and administrators on their familiarity and prioritization of CT, coupled with subsequent hour-long focus group discussions with educators to expand upon their respective district landscape survey responses. Results point to all districts perceiving the broad applicability of CT as a skill set and its integrative potential in a range of subjects. Yet in terms of classroom implementation, teachers find such CT integration decidedly less clear, recognizing it to be a priority but also reporting as less confident about creating their own curricular materials, where CT situates with their district's ongoing initiatives, and where they can find curricular resources and tools specific to their own areas of curricular integration. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Artificial general intelligence revived in recent years after people achieved significant advances in machine learning and deep learning. This leads to the thinking of how real intelligence could be created. Consciousness theories believe that general intelligence is essentially conscious, yet no universal definition is agreed upon. In this work, global workspace (GW) theory is implemented and integrated with crucial cognitive components. With the focus on episodic memory and inspiration from the nature of episodic memory in psychology and neuroscience, the episodic memory component is implemented within the GW framework. In our experiment, the robotic agent operates in a real-world interactive context, forming episodic memory and demonstrating static, temporal, and context memory capabilities during interactions. Consciousness in this work engages in all formation, maintenance, and retrieval processes of episodic memory. The novelty and contributions of this work are: 1) this work is implementing episodic memory within the consciousness framework, suggesting the sustainable potential of such an integrated approach to cognitive agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI); 2) regarding the limited examples in consciousness-based cognitive architectures, this work attempts to contribute to the diversity of perspectives and approaches; 3) extant episodic memory implementations are suffering from various limitations, while this work summarises some key features for modeling episodic memory within a cognitive architecture; and 4) authors discuss the relationship between episodic memory, consciousness, and general intelligence, proposing the compatibility and relationship between machine consciousness and other AGI research. It is believed that a better alignment between them would further boost the fusion of diverse research for achieving desired cognitive machines.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

Although the significance of CT has been highlighted, it could be challenging for educators to teach CT. Fortunately, adopting robots in education has been evidenced to be of benefit to promoting students’ learning motivation, CT, and higher-order thinking skills. However, several significant factors affecting students’ programming performances in robot-assisted learning activities have been identified, such as cognitive needs and organization. In this study, a CMR-BBP (concept map robot block-based programming) approach was designed by integrating concept maps into robot block-based programming to enhance students’ programming learning. Moreover, a three-group experiment was carried out in an elementary school to evaluate their learning outcomes. The experimental results revealed that the CMR-BBP approach benefited the students’ perceptions of their computational thinking and problem solving in comparison with the R-BBP (robot block-based programming) and C-BBP (conventional block-based programming) approaches. Furthermore, regarding cognitive load, both the CMR-BBP and R-BBP approaches enhanced the students’ germane cognitive load, while the CMR-BBP approach effectively reduced their extrinsic cognitive load.

However, software engineering education has not adequately addressed integrating comprehensive data science curricula, leaving students ill-equipped for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which is built on the foundations of data science.

Computed performance measures include area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

The three university students who were experienced in using Python program in computational problem-solving participated in the study. In data collection, a problem involving 'limit and sequence' from calculus was used to examine students' collaboration with ChatGPT. Students were asked to construct a program that produces a solution to this problem in Python, and meanwhile, it was stated that they could work in pairs with ChatGPT. The responses provided by ChatGPT to the students in the computational problem-solving were evaluated in both computational and mathematical contexts and a list of cases in which ChatGPT could and could not support students in the computational thinking practices was created. Aside from the incorrect or implicit answers provided by ChatGPT, in general, it was determined that ChatGPT supported the student's performance in computational thinking. It was deduced that it was important for the student to make a rational problem-solving plan and to guide the ChatGPT with the appropriate prompts in order to use rational questioning that leads to productive argumentation with ChatGPT. © 2024 IEEE.}},

Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students&#x2019; autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level. Authors}},

  abstract = {The rapid growing application of language models (LLMs) in education offers exciting prospects for personalized learning and interactive experiences. However, a critical challenge emerges - the risk of "hallucinations," where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information. This paper proposes Comparative and Cross-Verification Prompting (CCVP), a novel technique specifically designed to mitigate hallucinations in educational LLMs. CCVP leverages the strengths of multiple LLMs, a Principal Language Model (PLM) and Auxiliary Language Models (ALMs), to verify the accuracy and educational relevance of the PLM's response to a prompt. Through a series of prompts and assessments, CCVP harnesses the diverse perspectives of various LLMs and incorporates human expertise for intricate cases. This method addresses the limitations of relying on a single model and fosters critical thinking skills in learners within the educational context. We detail the CCVP approach with examples specifically applicable to educational settings, such as geography. We also discuss its strengths and limitations, including computational cost, data reliance, and ethical considerations. We highlight its potential applications in educational disciplines, including fact-checking content, detecting bias, and promoting responsible LLM use. CCVP presents a promising avenue for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated educational content. Further research and development will refine its scalability, address potential biases, and solidify its position as a vital tool for harnessing the power of LLMs while fostering responsible knowledge dissemination in education. © 2024 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Securing user electronics devices has become a significant concern in the digital period, and a forward-thinking solution covers the fusion of blockchain (BC) technology and deep learning (DL) methods. Blockchain improves device safety by transforming access management, storing credentials on a tamper-resistant ledger, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and giving a robust defence against malevolent actors. Integrating DL into this framework also raises safety measures, as it permits devices to inspect and regulate to develop attacks distinctly. DL models accurately recognize intricate designs and anomalies, allowing the technique to distinguish and threaten possible attacks in real time. The fusion of BC and DL not only improves the reliability of user electronics but also establishes a dynamic and adaptive safety system, enhancing consumer confidence in the safety of their devices. Therefore, this study presents a BC-Based Access Management with DL Threat Modeling (BCAM-DLTM) technique for securing consumer electronics devices in the IoT ecosystems. The BCAM-DLTM technique mainly follows a two-phase procedure: access management and threat detection. Moreover, BC technology can be applied to the access management of consumer electronics devices. Besides, the BCAM-DLTM technique applies a deep belief networks (DBNs) model for proficiently identifying threats. To enhance the recognition results of the DBN model, the hyperparameter tuning procedure uses the reptile search algorithm (RSA). The experimental outcome study of the BCAM-DLTM approach employs the NSLKDD dataset. The comprehensive results of the BCAM-DLTM approach portrayed a superior accuracy outcome of 99.63% over existing models in terms of distinct metrics.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs.

However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges.

  abstract = {In the last decade, educational reforms introduced technologies and digital tools to a higher degree, serving as powerful catalysts in educational innovation for creating, managing, and delivering content in STEM education with a focus on computational and engineering subjects. However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8-9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8-9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ' connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils' CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity.

We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

Seventy-six first-year undergraduates participated, including thirty in the CBS group and thirty-six in the COS group. Evaluations made from the results and processes of programming tasks were employed to describe computational performance and computational practices, respectively. Data gathered from CT skill surveys were thoroughly analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of computational perspectives.

Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities.

Even though the most important advantage of the distributed network is raising the level of security, the problem of security vulnerabilities with the extended networks remains. This paper is devoted to a novel strategy of Federated Learning (FL) that could become an applied solution for enhancing the safety of the IoT. Therefore, based on its decentralized knowledge process, FL allows IoT devices to cooperate in achieving common purposes without endangering data pri vacy. The paper uses this thinking method to deal with scalability, model personalization, and non-IID data that aren't IID distributing, suggesting solutions through model aggregation techniques or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Experimental evidence highlights that FL is very useful in enhancing IoT security irrespective of the diversity of its applications. To this end, residents of smart homes experienced a 17% increase in detecting the anomalies through the setting up of FL. This situation was replicated in the industrial Internet of Things, where the false positive rates were reduced from 20% to 5%, thus improving the system's efficiency. Furthermore, in the FL context in healthcare IoT ecosystems, this blazes a trail for privacy-preserving data analytics, preserving patient confidentiality and systematic profiling of noteworthy health trends. These findings thus demonstrate that FL is a feasible way of dealing with the security challenges of IoT scalable, promptly and in a manner that maintains user privacy. The article takes part in a conversation about ways to strengthen the security of IoT networks. Such a framework is based on the computational power of IoT devices. It allows us to detect and prevent threats in time. Nonetheless, it urges extensive R&D attempts to be introduced to develop better security solutions in IoT.

However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students' computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills.

  abstract = {Factor graph, as a bipartite graphical model, offers a structured representation by revealing local connections among graph nodes. This study explores the utilization of factor graphs in modeling the autonomous racecar planning problem, presenting an alternate perspective to the traditional optimizationbased formulation. We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach. While acknowledging the structural design advantages and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology, we also address its limitations and outline potential directions for future research.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

This kind of thinking makes it possible to simulate the intricate nanofluid behavior that incorporates the elastic and viscous responses, which are useful in a variety of situations related to nanofluid dynamics, rheology, and materials science. Additionally, the transport equations are modeled properly using Wakif's–Buongiorno nanofluid model.

Acting like skilled artisans, the adaptive neural splines deftly separate and reweave the image's fabric. Their subtle touch safeguards every strand of visual information, ensuring the final result is a harmonious tapestry of enhanced clarity and preserved detail. This harmonic connection reveals itself in a transforming process that combines many frames into a single, stunning tapestry. Shadows reveal their secrets, the previously opaque depths now shining with clarity.

These models provide intelligent solutions that are closer to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing (RS), the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research in RS focuses primarily on visual-understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-LMs (VLMs) excel as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. VLMs can go beyond visual recognition of RS images and can model semantic relationships as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). This article provides a comprehensive review of the research on VLMs in RS, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of VLMs in mainstream RS tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval (TBIR), VQA, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we analyze representative works and discuss research progress. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing works and provide possible directions for future development.

These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don't consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies.

  abstract = {In advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses - the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data - generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group (2×67 hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students' and end-users' computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability - beyond hardware and software development and recycling - with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Teaching coding and computational thinking is an emerging educational imperative, now embedded in compulsory curriculum in the United States, Finland, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Australia. This meta-synthesis of 49 studies critically reviews recent international research (2009–2022) of coding and computational thinking as core and integrated across the curriculum. It addresses four essential problems: (a) What are the key features of learning environments that successfully develop students’ coding and computational thinking? (b) What is the impact of student engagement in coding and computational thinking on learning outcomes across curriculum areas? (c) What pedagogical constraints are evident for coding and computational thinking, including across curriculum areas? and (d) Which conceptual frameworks support coding and computational thinking, and what has been marginalized or excluded? The review advances knowledge of coding and computational thinking—vital to guide and develop future AI-based solutions to real-world problems that challenge disciplinary boundaries. © 2024 AERA.}},

Although these robots are considerably more flexible than conventional industrial robots, when confronted with a new task, the human operator is often left to address related problems unaided. The aim of this research is to develop a smart collaborative robot, where a rapid and accurate robot and a flexible human operator work synergistically to achieve a common objective. In the proposed system, humans and robots work together to tackle the same combinatorial optimization problem; the robot actively engages in problem-solving, while the human has the ability to override the robot's actions if disagreements arise, and to execute alternative actions. To facilitate this collaboration, this paper presents the development of a manipulator that enables two separate control centers the human brain and the robot's computational system to cooperate in solving complex, cognitive-motor tasks.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on 'Learning by Teaching,' where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre-posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

  author = {Munasinghe B.; Bell T.; Robins A.}},
  year = {2023}},
  journal = {ACM Transactions on Computing Education}},
  abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming. It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution. In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

Despite the multifaceted nature of CT, the introduction of CT and associate concepts such as coding is regarded as developmental acceptable for preschool and kindergarten children. For a decade, there has been a focus on educational reform in the form of educational apps. For young children, an influx of mobile apps offering various interfaces and styles promote themselves as having educational value to introduce children aged 5–7 to essential CT, coding, and problem-solving skills. On the contrary, little is known about the educational value of these apps. The fast pace at which developers produce these apps and the breadth of the available apps have gone beyond what it is reasonable for researchers and experts in the domain to evaluate. This article presents a literature review on how the ScratchJr app affects young children's CT, coding, and general literacy skills. The literature review includes 18 studies. The main conclusion is that although ScratchJr is not a panacea, it seems to be a helpful app that positively affects children's CT and coding skills. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

First, by analyzing the thinking skills that have the greatest impact on top talents, the features of critical thinking skills, logical thinking skills and computational thinking skills are extracted separately. Then, a learner classification model for top talents was constructed by MKL method. Finally, the model was validated on the dataset and compared with the results of single-kernel learning. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the classification model for top talents based on MKL is significantly better than that of ordinary single-kernel learning, which indicates that the method of MKL performs better in the learner classification model. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this paper, we present results from a study that examined how elementary teachers understood debugging as well as how they saw the role of debugging to support student learning. Our findings indicate that most elementary teachers perceived debugging as a metacognitive support that allowed their students to shift how they approached problem-solving. Our findings also suggest that debugging may be a good starting point to allow elementary teachers to initially latch onto integrating CT. We discuss implications of our findings for integrating CT practices into classroom instruction. © 2023 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Since the release of LLM-based tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT the media and popular scientific literature, but also journals such as the Communications of the ACM, have been flooded with opinions how these tools will change programming. The opinions range from “machines will program themselves”, to “AI does not help programmers”. Of course, these statements are meant to to stir up a discussion, and should be taken with a grain of salt, but we argue that such unfounded statements are potentially harmful. Instead, we propose to investigate which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. In this paper we report on an experiment in which we explore if Computational Thinking (CT) skills predict the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools. Our results show that the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools can indeed be predicted by the score on a CT assessment. There are many limitations to our experiment, and this paper is also a call to discuss how to approach, preferably experimentally, the question of which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. We propose to rephrase this question to include by what kind of people/programmers, to develop what kind of software using what kind of LLM-based tools. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess CT in schools. This review applied a semi-automatic search for specific terms within the selected papers. These terms came from the analysis of several established definitions of CT. Results: We present a set of the most representative competencies and concepts developed in various experiences, in which the main topic is the assessment of CT, as well as some that have not been developed and that may be the subject of future works.

  abstract = {Background: Early exposure to Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) for all is critical to broaden participation and promote equity in the field. But how does the introduction of CS and CT into primary school curricula impact learning, perception, and gaps between groups of students? Methodology: We investigate a CS-curricular reform and teacher Professional Development (PD) programme from an equity standpoint by applying hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling on student learning and perception data from three studies with, respectively, 1384, 2433 and 1644 grade 3–6 students (ages 7–11) and their 83, 142 and 95 teachers. Results: Regarding learning, exposure to CS instruction appears to contribute to closing the performance gap between low-achieving and high-achieving students, as well as pre-existing gender gaps. Despite a lack of direct influence of what was taught on student learning, there is no impact of teachers’ demographics or motivation on student learning, with teachers’ perception of the CS-PD positively influencing learning. Regarding perception, students perceive CS and its teaching tools (robotics, tablets) positively, and even more so when they perceive a role model close to them as doing CS. Nonetheless, gender differences exist all around with boys perceiving CS more positively than girls despite access to CS education. However, access to CS-education affects boys and girls differently: larger gender gaps are closing (namely those related to robotics), while smaller gaps are increasing (namely those related to CS and tablets). Conclusion: This article highlights how a CS curricular reform impacts learning, perception, and equity and supports the importance of (i) early introductions to CS for all; (ii) preparing teachers to teach CS all the while removing the influence of teacher demographics and motivation on student outcomes; and (iii) having developmentally appropriate activities that signal to all groups of students. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.}},

Expanding interest in implementing a game-based approach in computer science education highlights the need for a comprehensive overview of the literature research. This scoping review aims to provide insight into current trends and identify research gaps and potential research topics concerning game-based learning in computer science. Using standard methodology for scoping review, we identified 113 articles from four digital libraries published between 2017 and 2021. Those articles were analyzed concerning the educational level, type of the game, computer science topic covered by the game, pedagogical strategies, and purpose for implementing this approach in different educational levels. The results show that the number of research articles has increased through the years, confirming the importance of implementing a game-based approach in computer science. Different kinds of games, using different technology, concerning different computer science topics are presented in the research. The obtained results indicate that there is no standardized game or standardized methodology that can be used for the creation of an educational game for computer science education. Analyzed articles mainly implement a game-based approach using learning by playing, and no significant focus is given to the effectiveness of learning by designing a game as a pedagogical strategy. Moreover, the approach is mainly implemented for developing computational thinking or programming skills, highlighting the need for its implementation in other topics beyond programming. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.}},

  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems}},
  abstract = {In this article, we propose a computationally and communicationally efficient approach for decision-making in nonequilibrium stochastic games. In particular, due to the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose nonequilibrium strategies, we construct two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning. In the first model, named level- $k$ thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs and - given such an assumption - chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, a level-recursive algorithm and a level-paralleled algorithm are constructed, where the latter one can have an overall reduced computational complexity. To further reduce the complexity in the communication layer, modifications of the proposed nonequilibrium strategies are presented, which do not require the action of a boundedly rational agent to be updated at each step of the stochastic game. Simulations are performed that demonstrate our results. © 2012 IEEE.}},

We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their preservice coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher’s CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education.

  abstract = {Background: There exist shared competencies between computational thinking (CT) and mathematics, and these two domains also mutually benefit from various teaching approaches. However, the linkages between mathematics and computational thinking lack robust empirical support, particularly from student-centered learning perspectives. Our study aimed to enhance our understanding of the connections between students' mathematics learning and computational thinking. To assess students' mathematics learning, we measured their beliefs about mathematics learning and their level of mathematical literacy (ML). Our hypothesis posited that students' beliefs concerning mathematics learning, encompassing their views on the nature of mathematics and their attitude towards the subject, can both directly and indirectly influence their CT, with ML serving as a mediating factor. Our data were gathered through surveys and tests administered to eighth- and ninth-grade students. Data were analyzed using partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS–SEM). Results: The evaluation of the measurement model indicated strong internal consistency for each construct. Both convergent and discriminant validity were also established. Upon assessing the structural model, it was found that beliefs about the nature of mathematics positively predicted attitudes towards mathematics, and this belief also indirectly predicted ML through positive attitudes towards mathematics. In addition, ML directly and positively predicted both CT subscales. Notably, a comprehensive mediating effect of ML on beliefs about mathematics learning and CT was identified in the analysis. Conclusions: This study advances the understanding of the relationships between mathematics learning and CT. We have further confirmed the importance of mathematical literacy in predicting CT and its mediating role between beliefs about mathematics learning and CT. It is suggested that teachers could promote students’ CT competence by enhancing their mathematical literacy or integrating mathematics and CT into the same learning activities. Finally, we propose that upcoming investigations treat CT assessments as formative constructs, diverging from their reflective counterparts. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

This program provides underrepresented youth, especially girls, with digital forensic knowledge, skills and career pathways, challenging them to explore complex social issues related to technology and to become cyber sleuths using real-world digital forensic methods and tools to solve investigative scenarios. Students also learn about related careers while improving their cyber street smarts. The CSSL incorporates additional “outside of the computer” activities to strengthen students’ engagement such as structured in-classroom discussions, mock trials, and in-person interactions with practitioner role models. The CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings, and the students predominantly represented racial minorities. Research in this project relied on a mixed methods approach for data collection and analysis,including qualitative and quantitative methods, reinforced using learning analytics generated from the students clicking through the interface and interacting with the system. Analysis of gathered data indicate that the virtual learning environment developed in this project is highly effective for teaching digital forensic knowledge, skills, and abilities that are directly applicable in the workplace. Furthermore, the strategies for gender inclusive STEM instruction implemented in CSSL are effective for engaging girls without being harmful to boys’ engagement. Learning STEM through digital forensic science taps into girls’ motivations to address real-world problems that have direct relevance to their lives, and to protect and serve their community. After participating in the educational program, girls expressed a significantly greater increase in interest, relative to boys, in learning more about careers related to digital forensics and cybersecurity. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

Many empirical studies in this area have yet to elaborate clearly and explicitly on how CT may support mathematics learning, or otherwise, in CT-based mathematics activities. Addressing this research gap, we conducted a systematic review on the integration of CT in K-12 mathematics education with a focus on CT-based mathematics instruction and students learning under such instruction. The Web of Science database was searched for in terms of studies published from 2006 to 2021, from which 24 articles were selected to provide illustrations of CT-based mathematics instruction and related student learning, and they were further analyzed according to education levels and contexts, programming tools, learning outcomes in CT and mathematics, and the mutual relationship between CT and mathematics learning. Among the results, this review found that geometrized programming and student-centered instructional approaches were facilitators of productive learning in CT and mathematics. Moreover, CT-based mathematics learning entails an interactive and cyclical process of reasoning mathematically and reasoning computationally, which can occur when: (1) applying mathematics to construct CT artefacts; (2) applying mathematics to anticipate and interpret CT outputs; and (3) generating new mathematical knowledge in parallel with the development of CT. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of what, and how, CT-based mathematics instruction impacts student learning in K-12 contexts. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

As a current undergraduate who has helped teach secondary school computer science, I witnessed firsthand the problems with current approaches. I, therefore, propose a shift in the focus of computing education research away from teaching “coding” effectively to elucidating a more abstract but nevertheless more pragmatic characterization of computer science as an academic field, rather than programming as a trade. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

However, current evidence of the effectiveness of unplugged activities in promoting students’ CT skills has been inconsistent. To understand the potential of unplugged activities on computational thinking skills, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Our review of 49 studies examined the influence of unplugged activities to improve students’ CT skills in K–12 education between 2006 and 2022. The literature review showed that studies on CT skills were mainly (81.64%) conducted in computer science and STEM education, with board and card games being the most common unplugged activities for fostering CT skills in K–12 education. CT diagnostic tools (36.37%) were frequently used as assessment tools. A follow-up meta-analysis of 13 studies with 16 effect sizes showed a generally large overall effect size (Hedges’s g = 1.028, 95% CI [0.641, 1.415], p < 0.001) for the use of unplugged activities in promoting students’ CT skills. The analysis of several moderator variables (i.e., grade level, class size, intervention duration, and learning tools) and their possible effects on CT skills indicated that unplugged activities are a promising instructional strategy for enhancing students’ CT skills. Taken together, the results highlight the affordances of unplugged pedagogy for promoting CT skills in K–12 education.

Mainly, the effect of IVR on learning outcomes has been the focus. However, far too little attention has been paid to the influence of game elements and IVR features on learners’ perceived cognition. This study examined the relationship between game elements (challenge, goal clarity, and feedback) as pedagogical approach, features of IVR technology (immersion and interaction), and learners’ perceived cognition (reflective thinking and comprehension). An experiment was conducted with 49 undergraduate students who played an IVR game-based application (iThinkSmart) containing mini games developed to facilitate learners’ computational thinking competency. The study employed partial least squares structural equation modelling to investigate the effect of educational game elements and learning contents on learner’s cognition. Findings show that goal clarity is the main predictor of learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension in an educational game-based IVR application. It was also confirmed that immersion and interaction experience impact learner’s comprehension. Notably, adequate learning content in terms of the organisation and relevance of the content contained in an IVR game-based application significantly moderate learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension. The findings of this study have implications for educators and developers of IVR game-based intervention to facilitate learning in the higher education context.

Today’s scientists not only leverage computational tools to conduct their investigations, they often must contribute to the design of the computational tools for their specific research. From a science education perspective, for students to learn authentic science practices, students must learn to use the tools of the trade. This necessity in science education has shaped recent K–12 science standards including the Next Generation Science Standards, which explicitly mention the use of computational tools and simulations. These standards, in particular, have gone further and mandated that computational thinking be taught and leveraged as a practice of science. While computational thinking is not a new term, its inclusion in K–12 science standards has led to confusion about what the term means in the context of science learning and to questions about how to differentiate computational thinking from other commonly taught cognitive skills in science like problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, and critical thinking. In this paper, we propose a definition of computational thinking for science (CT-S) and a framework for its operationalization in K–12 science education. We situate our definition and framework in Activity Theory, from the learning sciences, in order to position computational thinking as an input to and outcome of science learning that is mediated by computational tools. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

We collected and analyzed interview data for 16 participants on their experiences within the course and attitudes towards various output and coding modalities. Throughout the study, the students’ reflections on their own learning revealed the affordances and drawbacks of each resource in terms of outputs the resources provided, feedback the students received, and how both affected the students’ troubleshooting. We present these findings and use them to provide recommendations for approaches to teaching computer science. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) education has drawn increasing attention from educators and researchers. This study conducted a meta-analysis of 27 empirical studies to examine the effectiveness of game-based learning (GBL) for fostering students’ CT. The effects of various factors on the learning process for acquiring CT were also examined. The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students’ CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges’ g =.600, 95% CI [.465,.735], p <.001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students’ CT concepts (Hedges’ g =.916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p <.001), CT skills (Hedges’ g =.494, 95% CI [.389,.600], p <.001), and CT perspectives (Hedges’ g =.927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p <.05). (c) Additionally, game mode, teaching context, and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings, it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games, designing collaborative game activities, and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT. The results have significance for fostering students’ CT in GBL; it is further suggested that instruction processes be rationally designed. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

This paper reports on our recent development of the deterministic random walk model in NetLogo, a leading platform for computational thinking, eco-system thinking, and multi-agent cross-platform programming environment. The deterministic random walk is foundational to modeling dynamical processes on complex networks. Inspired by the temporal visualizations offered in NetLogo, we investigated the relationship between network topology and diffusion saturation time for the deterministic random walk model. Our analysis uncovers that in Erdős–Rényi graphs, the saturation time exhibits an asymmetric pattern with a considerable probability of occurrence. This behavior occurs when the hubs, defined as nodes with relatively higher number of connections, emerge in Erdős–Rényi graphs. Yet, our analysis yields that the hubs in Barabási–Albert model stabilize the the convergence time of the deterministic random walk model. These findings strongly suggest that depending on the dynamical process running on complex networks, complementing characteristics other than the degree need to be taken into account for considering a node as a hub.

Children aged 5–6 years (231 girls and 219 boys; treatment group: 334 children; control group: 116 children) were tested on computational thinking, vocabulary, numeracy, self-regulation, and social behavior before and after receiving STEAM curriculum that included robotics activities or an equivalent curriculum. Results: Findings revealed that among the outcome measures, young children in the treatment group exhibited significant increases in computational thinking and expressive vocabulary. Moreover, gender demonstrated a significant interaction effect with the increase in computational thinking as measured by an assessment developed for a specific robotic material as well as in self-regulation and social behavior. Conclusions: This study provides empirical and comprehensive evidence regarding the effectiveness of an integrated STEAM program with developmentally appropriate robotic kits for young children. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

Game-based learning (GBL) may be used to teach CT, and it’s necessary to clarify how to design and implement game-based CT teaching. The literature was systematically searched for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2021. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT, but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g., conditions, triggers, and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students’ preferences for using CT elements. Game elements, particularly clear goals and rules, progressive challenges, immediate feedback, storyline, avatar, social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore, single or multiple theoretical foundations, such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory, may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities. Problem-solving, project-based approaches were used to encourage students to use CT to solve problems or complete a project. Finally, guidelines for designing and implementing game-based learning activities for promoting CT were discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

The advantage of quantum computing is that it has the potential to solve computationally complex problems in a fixed amount time, independent of the size of the problem. However, the kinds of problems for which these computers are a good fit, and the ways to express those problems, are substantially different from the kinds of problems and expressions used in classical computing. Quantum annealers, in particular, are currently the most promising and available quantum computing devices in the short term. However, they are also the most foreign compared to classical programs, as they require a different kind of computational thinking. In order to ease the transition into this new world of quantum computing, we present a novel quantum approach to a well-known software problem: code clone detection. We express code clone detection as a subgraph isomorphism problem that is mapped into a quadratic optimization problem, and solve it using a DWave quantum annealing computer. We developed a quantum annealing algorithm that compares Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and reports an energy value that indicates how similar they are. The motivation behind this research goes well beyond code duplicate detection: our approach paves the way into how to express software engineering problems as optimization problems that can be solved by quantum annealers.  © 2023 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed debate about whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be conscious or sentient. This paper identifies two approaches to the topic and argues: (1) A 'Cartesian' approach treats consciousness, sentience, and personhood as very similar terms, and treats language use as evidence that an entity is conscious. This approach, which has been dominant in AI research, is primarily interested in what consciousness is, and whether an entity possesses it. (2) An alternative 'Hobbesian' approach treats consciousness as a sociopolitical issue and is concerned with what the implications are for labeling something sentient or conscious. This both enables a political disambiguation of language, consciousness, and personhood and allows regulation to proceed in the face of intractable problems in deciding if something 'really is' sentient. (3) AI systems should not be treated as conscious, for at least two reasons: (a) treating the system as an origin point tends to mask competing interests in creating it, at the expense of the most vulnerable people involved; and (b) it will tend to hinder efforts at holding someone accountable for the behavior of the systems. A major objective of this paper is accordingly to encourage a shift in thinking. In place of the Cartesian question - is AI sentient? - I propose that we confront the more Hobbesian one: Does it make sense to regulate developments in which AI systems behave as if they were sentient?  © 2020 Tsinghua University Press.}},

Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors.

The research results were analyzed by midterm and final experimental group scores, and the progress of the experimental group’s scores was examined through descriptive statistics. The average and standard deviation of the assessment were used to analyze the progress of the experimental group students in the programming course. In the classroom, assessment criteria were set up as the basis for peer assessment scoring. After the midterm and final exams, the teacher assessment and peer assessment scores were analyzed for cognitive differences, and possible learning differences were analyzed.

To this end, based on Sternberg's intelligence education theory, combined with software development and programming knowledge, a structural framework of computational thinking was constructed. Subsequently, a project-based teaching activity based on this framework to cultivate students' computational thinking skills was carried out in the college computer programming course "Software Development Technology". By measuring students' computational thinking skills before and after the activity, it was verified that the project-based teaching model based on the proposed framework had a significant effect on improving students' computational thinking skills. By constructing a structural framework of computational thinking that integrates the characteristics of disciplines, and taking programming teaching as a carrier to implement the cultivation of computational thinking skills, it can provide a new way for computer educators to cultivate students' computational thinking skills.  © 2023 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Programming and computational thinking (CT) have become important topics in elementary education and are being implemented by national curricula, extracurricular programs, and informal learning environments. Most related research and implementation is mainly focused on block-based programming (BBP). However, BBP can lead to bad programming habits and a later transition to text-based programming (TBP) has been shown to be difficult for students, as they can lose confidence and motivation. Thus, we developed a course to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP and foster CT while also promoting motivation and students' programming-related self-concept. We considered data from 27 fourth-grade students aged 9 to 10, who participated in the course as part of an extracurricular enrichment program. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed CT and its cognitive correlates such as non-verbal visuospatial reasoning, verbal reasoning, arithmetic competencies as well as the student's motivation and attitude towards programming. Results indicated improved students' CT, arithmetic, and non-verbal visuospatial reasoning. Furthermore, the transition to TBP did not significantly reduce students' motivation for programming. Taken together, these findings indicate that the developed intervention may be helpful to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP while keeping the students motivated and fostering CT.  © 2023 ACM.}},

Research has revealed that CT can be encouraged with children as young as 3–4 years of age. While some preschools and schools are incorporating CT into their curriculum for young children, ages 0–8 years, it is important to understand how environments outside of schools are using CT with young children, particularly given that, in the United States, a large percent of young children, ages 0–5 years, are not in formal school settings. This study provides insight into this area through 20 interviews with educators in libraries and museums to understand how they incorporate CT into their work with young children, ages 0–8 years, and their families.

  abstract = {Reintroducing computer science (CS) education in K–12 schools to promote computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant attention among scholars and educators. Among the several essential components included in CS and CT education, program debugging is an indispensable skill. However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and 75 fifth-grade students attended the unassisted flipped debugging training lessons without the SDP–modeling method. The results indicated that flipped debugging training using the SDP–modeling method improved students’ debugging skills. The results from the questionnaire showed that the proposed teaching approach increased the students’ investment in germane cognitive load by promoting schema construction. It also helped reduce students’ intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in learning. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

Various tests have been developed in the field of Computer Science Education for different age groups, primarily at university level for introductory Computer Science courses, and some for upper secondary school level and below, particularly for Computational Thinking.

  abstract = {The implementation of computational thinking concepts in primary school curricula usually includes programming activities. As primary school teachers often lack subject knowledge, they may struggle to help students during these programming activities. Additional support can be provided by automated program analysis, for example in terms of hints on conceptual knowledge related to bad coding patterns observed, or procedural hints on how to solve the task at hand. However, care has to be taken since these hints need to balance (1) helping students to perform a specific task successfully, while nevertheless (2) ensuring a learning effect beyond the specific task. To understand the effects of different types of hints we therefore conducted a study with 36 children aged 7-12 in 10 programming courses. After being introduced to basic programming structures in three units, the children were tasked to debug six Scratch programs using different types of hints, where we observed that procedural hints have the strongest impact on performance. In order to examine an impact on the transfer of learned knowledge, we observed the children's difficulties during the successive fifth unit, in which they created their own projects. The results of the fifth unit show that having received a procedural hint on a specific pattern during the fourth unit leads to slightly fewer bad related code patterns but also to slightly fewer good code patterns. Considering these results together with the subjective perceptions of the children, we can derive insights into how to best support performance and learning using (automated) feedback.  © 2023 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking is a way of thinking that helps people “think like a computer scientist” to solve practical problems. However, practicing computational thinking through programming is dependent on the problem solvers’ metacognition. This study investigated students’ metacognitive planning and problem-solving performance in programming through two quantitative studies. First, we analyzed the performance of metacognitive planning and of problem solving through the programming of 21 freshmen, and found that the metacognitive planning performance related to “problem description” and “program comprehension” was significantly correlated with problem-solving performance. Second, semi-scaffolding and full-scaffolding were designed based on the first study. Another 89 freshmen were randomly divided into three groups and were asked to write their programming plan with no-scaffolding, semi-scaffolding, or with full-scaffolding. ANCOVA revealed that the problem-solving performance of the no-scaffolding group was significantly weaker than that of the other two groups, but there was no significant difference between the semi-scaffolding and the full-scaffolding groups. The study indicated that semi-scaffolding had a similar effect to full-scaffolding on problem-solving performance. The study suggests that teachers should emphasize supporting students’ “problem description” and “program comprehension” using semi-scaffolding. This scaffolding technique is sufficient and efficient for training students’ computational thinking through problem solving in programming. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  abstract = {From the philosophical point of view, granular computing (GrC) attempts to abstract and formalize the way of human cognition to extract a structured thinking mode. Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.  © 2016 IEEE.}},

A variety of software development patterns are explored for their compatibility with holonic multi-agency. The current skill sets required by software development workers and concomitant training activities focus on instilling computational thinking abilities, a set of related cognitive competencies useful in the development of such systems. Intelligent systems play an increasingly important role in modern development and often benefit from computational intelligence techniques for the purpose of parameter tuning.

To explore how teachers generally proceed when creating programming tasks, whether tool support can help, and how it is perceived by teachers, we performed a pre-study with 26 and a main study with 59 teachers in training and the LitterBox static analysis tool for Scratch. We find that teachers in training (1) often start with brainstorming thematic ideas rather than setting learning objectives, (2) write code before the task text, (3) give more hints in their task texts and create fewer bugs when supported by LitterBox, and (4) mention both positive aspects of the tool and suggestions for improvement.

All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop.

We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students' attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition.

Also, in this experience, the TG program was carried out during class hours, and at both single- and mixed-gender vocational high schools. We applied an existing computational thinking test to the 2020 cohort (approx. 1000 students), before and after participating in the program, analyzing the results by school, gender and age. We found a slight improvement in test scores, with a more positive effect in male students.  © 2023 ACM.}},

While literature on computing education is vast, it remains unexplored how existing CT conceptualisations relate to the learning opportunities needed for a meaningful application of coding in non-Computer Scientists’ lives and careers. In order to identify and organise the learning opportunities in the literature about CT, we conducted a configurative literature review of studies published on Web of Science, between 2006 and 2021. Our sample gathers 34 papers and was analysed on NVivo to find key themes. We were able to organise framings of CT and related learning opportunities into three dimensions: functional, collaborative, and critical and creative. These dimensions make visible learning opportunities that range from individual cognitive development to interdisciplinary working with others, and to active participation in a technologically evolving society. By comparing and contrasting frameworks, we identify and explain different perspectives on skills. Furthermore, the three-dimensional model can guide pedagogical design and practice in coding courses. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

Analyses included the distribution of correct decomposition item responses, confirmatory factor analysis, and item-level error analysis. Results indicate wide variability in students' performance on the decomposition assessment items as well as in performance on items contextualized within mathematics.

Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively.

However, developing effective adaptive programming tasks can be challenging, particularly when it comes to selecting the appropriate changes and adapting the difficulty of the exercise. In this paper, we propose a model for tracking student knowledge and adapting programming exercises to guide the selection and implementation of task features. Our model combines aspects of cognitive load, computational thinking and feature-oriented software product line engineering to identify core and optional features, so that they can be used in conjunction to adapt to the specific needs and abilities of each student. We provide an overview over the insights gained from an exploratory study with students.

We present Cartoonimator, a low-cost, paper-based computational kit for children to create animations and engage with computational thinking. Cartoonimator requires only paper and a smartphone to use, offering an affordable learning experience. Children can draw the scenes and characters for their animation on the paper, which is printed with computer vision markers. We developed the mobile web app to provide an interface to capture keyframes and compile them into animations.

  abstract = {Most studies suggest that students develop computational thinking (CT) through learning programming. However, when the target of CT is decoupled from programming, emerging evidence challenges the assertion of CT transferability from programming. In this study, CT was operationalized in everyday problem-solving contexts in a learning experiment (n = 59) that investigated whether learning programming enhances students’ CT skills. Specifically, this study examined the influence of a novel, systematic and micro instructional strategy that is grounded in abstraction and comprised of four independent but related processes – discover, extract, create, and assemble (DECA) towards simplification of problem-solving. Subsidiary questions explored the effects of students’ age, gender, computer proficiency, and prior programming experience on the development of CT. No significant difference was found between the CT skill and programming knowledge of the groups at the posttest. However, within-group paired t-tests showed that the experimental group that integrated DECA had significant improvement in CT but not in the control group across the pretest-posttest axis. Implications of the inconclusive finding about the transfer of programming skills to CT are emphasized and the arguments for disentangling CT from programming are highlighted. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

The integration of math+CT enables students to gain a deeper understanding of both mathematical and computer science (CS) concepts. Although numerous professional development programs provide teachers with a solid understanding of CT and methods for integrating it into the curriculum, there has been little research on how teachers apply this knowledge to the design and development of math+CT activities. Moreover, the majority of integrated activities are concentrated in the upper elementary grades, while the early grades (i.e., K-2) remain underexplored. The purpose of this study is to describe how teachers translate their CT knowledge in the collaborative design of an integrated math+CT activity focused on number sense and mathematical operations for grades K-2. Research faculty from the CS and Teacher Education departments designed block-based programming activities for K-2 students to explore and make sense of place value representations of the numbers 1 - 1000. In-service elementary teachers in an online graduate STEM CT course (N = 13) experienced these activities as learners and provided feedback for redesign from their perspectives as classroom teachers. Qualitative analysis of collaborative problem-solving slides and individual reflections revealed how teachers connected their mathematical knowledge for teaching place value to their emergent understanding of CT concepts of abstraction, decomposition, and debugging. This research bridges the gap between enthusiasm for math+CT integration and teacher capacity to use CT to promote creative mathematical thinking and problem-solving in K-2 classrooms. © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

Though there has been much research and innovation in recent years to help reduce high failure rates, a substantial population of students still struggle in a typical CS1 course. In this paper we create an argument of validity of the Placement Skills Inventory (PSIv1). The goal of the PSIv1 is to help advise and place students into an appropriate introductory computing course. While placement exams have been developed in the past, the goal of PSIv1 is to differentiate students who will be successful in a CS1 course and those that would be better served taking a CS0 course as their first computing course. In contrast, traditional placement exams have focused on differentiating students between CS1 and CS2. The PSIv1 is a combination of two instruments, the Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test and the Second Computer Science 1 Exam Revised Version 2. These two instruments measure students' computation thinking skills and prior programming knowledge respectively. The PSIv1 was administered to all students enrolled in either a CS0 or CS1 during the first two weeks of the semester. We use Item Response Theory to create an argument of validity of the PSIv1 and look at differences in scores on the PSIv1 based on if a student passed or failed a CS0 and CS1 course. We then used the results to create an advising strategy and criteria to help students decided if they should enroll in a CS0 or CS1 course. © 2023 ACM.}},

However, little is known about the types of problems for which Copilot does not perform well, or about the natural language interactions that a student might have with Copilot when resolving errors. We explore these questions by evaluating the performance of Copilot on a publicly available dataset of 166 programming problems. We find that it successfully solves around half of these problems on its very first attempt, and that it solves 60% of the remaining problems using only natural language changes to the problem description. We argue that this type of prompt engineering, which we believe will become a standard interaction between human and Copilot when it initially fails, is a potentially useful learning activity that promotes computational thinking skills, and is likely to change the nature of code writing skill development. © 2023 ACM.}},

This meta-analysis examined the effects of computational thinking integration in STEM on students’ STEM learning performance in the K-12 education context. Following systematic procedures, we identified 20 publications with 21 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from a range of academic databases. We extracted effect sizes on student learning outcomes in one-group pretest-posttest designs. We also examined a range of moderating variables in the models, including student levels, STEM disciplines, intervention durations, alignment with content standards (e.g., CSTA/NGSS), types of intervention (e.g., simulation), and the use of unplugged/plugged activities. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (g = 0. 85 [95% CI of 0.57–1.14]; p <.001), indicating a large overall effect of computational thinking integration on STEM learning outcomes. The effect sizes were significantly moderated by intervention durations. We provide a discussion of the findings and present implications for future research and practice. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

We sought to explore the connections between Latinx elementary students' coding attitudes and computational thinking (CT) skills after participating in a year-long, remote computing curriculum in a public school district in Southern California. We collected validated measures on coding attitudes and CT skills for 164 fourth-grade students. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the relationship between the coding attitude constructs (i.e., confidence, utility, perception of coders, social influences, and interest) and scores on a CT assessment while controlling for demographic factors (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free or reduced lunch status, reading and math standardized test scores). In a model demonstrating acceptable fit, only math scores were a significant predictor of CT scores and coding confidence. Confidence was found to be significantly associated with the other attitude constructs except for perception of coders. Our results indicate that confidence plays a prominent role in student computing learning, especially at a young age. Efforts to better support Latinx students in computer science should include strategies that address students' coding confidence, such as developing positive perceptions of a student's learning process (e.g., failures as learning opportunities) in specific coding skills and practices (e.g., tinkering, debugging). © 2023 Owner/Author.}},

When expressing their identities, students narrated their experiences, expressed consciousness about their skills, connected to the user via their interests, and sometimes discussed equity.

Statistical thinking and magical thinking, too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines, I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control, surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts. This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention. My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations, the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between statistics and algorithmic data biases. This article suggests a speculative genealogy of astrology and artificial intelligence, as well as a genealogy of the theological, scientific and machinic unconscious. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  abstract = {The worldwide push for computing education at younger ages requires that teachers are prepared to deliver instruction that supports all learners. Other discipline-based education research fields offer a wealth of instructional scaffolds worthy of exploration in computing. One such scaffold drawn from math education is diagramming. While diagrams are frequently employed in university computing, little is known about its applications in K-8 (ages 6-14) computing. To inform diagram design for K-8 computing, we investigated how the spatial orientation of a diagram (horizontal or vertical) influenced the extent to which K-8 teachers developed different technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) of computational thinking (CT) concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and decomposition. We found that more teachers were able to decompose a sequence of events when using a vertical diagram. While teachers in both conditions were similarly able to describe various CT concepts and aspects of TPACK, more teachers using a vertical diagram made connections between concepts, whereas more teachers using a horizontal diagram described concepts in isolation. We hope this exploration will spur future work into diagramming and more broadly, spatial reasoning in K-8 computing. © 2023 Owner/Author.}},

The empirical study has successfully produced a new checklist that can be used as a tool to describe the learning of CT skills when children co-create digital games. The checklist consists of 10 core CT skills: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, generalisation, representation, socialisation, code literacy, automation, coordination, and debugging. Thirty-six 10–12 year-olds from sub-urban primary schools in Borneo participated in creating games in three separate eight-hour sessions. In addition, one pilot session with five participants was conducted. The game co-creation process was recorded to identify and determine how these young, inexperienced, untrained young learners collaborated while using CT skills. Analysis of their narratives while co-creating digital games revealed a pattern of using CT while developing the games. Although none of the groups demonstrated the use of all ten CTs, conclusively, all ten components of the CT were visibly present in their co-created digital games. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an emerging and multifaceted competence important to the computing era. However, despite the growing consensus that CT is a competence domain, its theoretical and empirical account remain scarce in the current literature. To address this issue, rigorous psychometric evaluation procedures were adopted to investigate the structure of CT competency, as measured by Computational Thinking Challenge (Lai, 2021a), in a large sample of 1,130 British secondary school students (Mage = 14.14 years, SDage = 1.45). Based on model comparison from an exploratory multidimensional item response theory approach, the results supported the multidimensional operationalization of CT competency. A confirmatory bi-factor item response theory model further suggested CT competency is comprised of a general CT competency factor and two specific factors for programming and non-programming problem-solving. Despite the multidimensionality, the common variance is largely explained by a primary general factor of CT competency, thus the use of a single scale score is recommended. Psychometric evaluation from the bi-factor model indicated good psychometric properties of the assessment tool. Overall, the bi-factor model provides a useful approach to investigating CT competency and serves as a robust test validation tool. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

Springfield Public Schools, a large urban school district in Massachusetts composed of over 25,000 students and 4,500 teachers, chose to prioritize the needs of their district's community. Over the past 5 years, district leaders, school level administrators, researchers, evaluators, and educators have been involved in a large-scale Research Practice Partnership (RPP) funded by a National Science Foundation grant. Over 50 teachers in the district wrote and revised computer science lessons to be integrated into preexisting content areas. Unique to this project, many teacher leaders were developed starting with five teacher coordinators who quickly became the guiding force of the project. These coordinators were able to develop skills necessary to coordinate a large-scale Research Practice Partnership (RPP) and made it their purpose to utilize other up and coming educators within the district to maximize exposure of the project, utilize their acquired knowledge and experiences, and create sustainability. We have built the capacity for educators involved in the project to become facilitators in a variety of areas throughout the district. From the onset of the project teachers, working as design team members and early adopters of the curriculum, gained various skill sets and knowledge from explicit professional development (PD) in focused areas. Some of these areas included working and gaining knowledge with platforms and devices, team building and collaboration techniques, lesson development strategies, understanding of computer science standards, and an equitable mindset connected to building and creating lessons for students and strengthening opportunities for the students in our school community. This process evolved and grew our current facilitators. Educators involved have become mentor teachers, facilitators of professional development (PD), gained exposure in national and regional conferences, and even been hired as academic supervisors in the district. The RPP plans to continue to foster the development and growth of teacher leaders to guarantee the success of the project long after the RPP is complete as well as support the vast needs of a large diverse school district. © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

We then classify the students and study the relationship between the different categories, the code complexity, and the time to derive the final solution.

Indeed, syntax errors—which form one of two broad categories of errors in programming, the other one being logic errors—are omitted while block programming. However, this does not mean that errors are omitted at large in such environments. In this exploratory case study of a learning environment for early programming (Kodetu), we explored errors in block programming of middle school students (N = 123), using log files drawn from a block-based online. Analyzing 1033 failed executions, we found that errors may be driven by either learners’ knowledge and behavior, or by the learning environment design. The rate of error types was not associated with the learners’ and contextual variables examined, with the exception of task complexity (as defined by SOLO taxonomy).

Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch.

Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students' learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment.

  abstract = {With the progress of science and technology, quantum computing plays an increasingly important role in various fields, solving the traditional arithmetic bottleneck. In the financial field, credit scoring is the core of the lending industry and one of the most common risk management tools. Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8. Secondly, this paper converts these three strategies to the QUBO model and obtains the maximum final income that is consistent with the maximum under the traditional model, with an accuracy of 96.3%, 92.7%, and 89.9% for the three combination strategies, respectively.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Phishing, a prevalent cyber danger in contemporary times, involves the fraudulent impersonation of legitimate websites with the intention of deceiving users into divulging confidential information. The insufficiency of classic phishing detection tools has become apparent as fraudsters continue to develop new strategies; these approaches mostly depend on variables such as URL character sequences, site content, and visual resemblance. The present study highlights the "Zérosdetect" approach, a quantum-powered technique for detecting phishing URLs using zero-shot learning, a robust model that makes use of both the zero-shot learning's adaptability and the computational advantageous nature of quantum computing, it mitigates the need for extensive previous knowledge of phishing URL attributes. In order to detect previously undiscovered phishing attacks, quantum neural network have been deployed to convert URL data into quantum spaces, therefore using the computational benefits of quantum systems. Quantum layers embedded inside Qnodes are a key part of the present system, calculating gradients at a faster pace, optimizing the network performance by rapidly calculating gradients, making the solution both efficient and forward-thinking. The present study lays the groundwork for future cybersecurity initiatives in the era of quantum computing, enhancing the potential to predict new cases of phishing. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) skills are a key competency for all citizens, but for Computer Programming students these abilities are crucial. Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children's education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain's learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master's Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) assessment indicator assignment is an important strategy for optimizing assessment and an effective method for exploring differences in the importance of assessment indicators. However, the objectivity of the previous methods for assigning assessment indicators of CT is insufficient. Therefore, the paper proposed to use the XGBoost machine learning model to fit the assessment data, fully explore the data features and realize the weighting of CT assessment indicators. The CT assessment indicators are used as the features of XGBoost model training and the assessment levels are used as the training labels to obtain the feature weights through XGBoost model training. The feature weights are used as the CT assessment indicator weights to realize the weighting of assessment indicators of CT in reverse. From the analysis of the CT assessment indicator assignment results, the analysis of the importance of the assessment indicators and the comparative analysis of the assessment results before and after the indicator assignment, it is found that the CT assessment after the indicator assignment has higher robustness and credibility. © 2023 IEEE.}},

We consider the application of automotive MIMO radar, which traditionally synthesizes a large uniform virtual array by appropriate waveform and physical array design. We explore deliberately introducing holes into this virtual array to leverage resolution gains provided by the increased aperture. The presence of these holes requires re-thinking DOA estimation, as conventional algorithms may no longer be easily applicable and alternative techniques, such as array interpolation, may be computationally expensive. Consequently, we study sparse array geometries that permit the direct application of spatial smoothing. We show that a sparse array geometry is amenable to spatial smoothing if it can be decomposed into the sum set of two subsets of suitable cardinality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many such decompositions may exist-not all of them yielding equal identifiability or aperture. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee identifiability of a given number of targets, which gives insight into choosing desirable decompositions for spatial smoothing. This provides uniform recovery guarantees and enables estimating DOAs at increased resolution and reduced computational complexity.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This work-in-progress paper introduces an innovative approach that uses computational notebooks to teach Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate course to aid the understanding of complex phenomena in Mechanics of Materials, and enhance students' computational thinking skills. Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills. Early exposure to coding, modeling, and simulation techniques is crucial in preparing students for the computational demands of modern engineering workplaces. © 2023 IEEE.}},

It is considered a cross disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which focuses on nature's real complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of computing skills acquisition, through problem-based activities to offer powerful knowledge to a wide group of learners. Therefore, quantum technology knowledge should be accessible to students and teachers, in a more interactive way. In this paper, we propose contemporary and Problem based scenarios, in which students may acquire stronger mathematical, computational and modelling skills, working as real researchers. Thus, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to quantum principles, such as superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games we propose, relate to strategic games, within the computational thinking 2.0 framework.

The students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering showed the practical value of computational thinking in non-IT disciplines, particularly in using specialized software such as MATLAB. For students with foundational knowledge, the learning sequence between learning computational thinking and programming was less significant. However, for beginners or those from non-IT backgrounds, effective learning required the coherence and integration of courses.

  abstract = {Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {With the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity - a project - using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students' work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This Research to Practice Work-in-Progress paper discusses a next-generation learning system for K-12 students to educate them on scientific concepts surrounding the human body. Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled 'Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking' for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role. © 2023 IEEE.}},

Most of the traditional economic models based on econometrics are linear models. Although such a model is a powerful economic analysis tool, it also has its own defects, that is, it can not reflect a large number of nonlinear relationships in the economic system.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach α of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This practice work-in-progress paper describes an innovative laboratory course designed to introduce a heterogenous cohort of undergraduate students from various fields of engineering and science to the principles of designing and analyzing complex electronic systems. The course utilizes a self-developed drum machine as a visual and acoustic project with a gradually increasing level of complexity throughout the lab sessions. Through active participation students acquire an understanding of SPICE simulations, test & measurement equipment, and printed circuit board (PCB) assembly. The course is mandatory for students pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical, mechatronic, biomedical, computational, and information system engineering, and is also attended as an optional module by computer science and physics students. In the winter term of 2022, the course returned to the lab after the COVID-19 pandemic and was attended by more than 200 students. The laboratory experiments are supported by complementary activities, such as SPICE simulations of the circuits as preparation, and lab reports written in LaTeX to introduce the students to scientific writing. Instructional videos and consultation hours are offered to assist with SPICE simulation and LaTeX. During the physical lab sessions, students work in groups of three in a traditional laboratory environment, with student tutors available to provide guidance offered in the form of minimal help. Overall, the presented lab course is an innovative and engaging method of teaching electronic systems. The self-developed drum machine provides a visually and audibly stimulating project, allowing students to learn practical skills and develop their theoretical knowledge. © 2023 IEEE.}},

Construction students need to develop computational thinking skills to help make sense of this data, but existing data science environments designed with textual programming languages create a significant barrier to entry. To bridge this gap, we introduce Octave, an end-user programming environment designed to help non-expert programmers analyze spatiotemporal data (e.g., as gathered by a GPS sensor) in an interactive graphical user interface. To aid exploration and understanding, Octave's design incorporates a high degree of liveness, highlighting the interconnection between data, computation, and visualization. We share the underlying design principles behind Octave and details about the system design and implementation. To evaluate Octave, we conducted a usability study with students studying construction. The results show that non-programmer construction students were able to learn Octave easily and were able to effectively use it to solve domain-specific problems from construction education. The participants appreciated Octave's liveness and felt they could easily connect it to real-life problems in their field.

  abstract = {6G is currently under definition, being often addressed from a plain telecommunications perspective as an evolutionary paradigm that represents an extension of 5G. Having as a horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe to further ignite the development of 6G services. At its philosophical core, 6G embodies the "human in the loop" principle. The research effort being developed towards 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications up to services and business cases. The contributions of this book to research in the field concern an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together four different computational areas: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. The book is derived from initial brainstorming that was developed during the 11th CONASENSE Symposium held in October 2021 in fortiss, Munich, Germany. Several international experts contribute to an overview of 6G key challenges, new networking trends and challenges to be overcome, and advanced 6G services. The book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges and use-cases beyond the 2030 horizon, to then continue to address the role of non-terrestrial networks and cognitive, service-centric satellite networks in future 6G services. Still with focus on 6G adaptive networking, the book continues with a debate on the need to integrate social awareness based on an interdisciplinary approach in network operations. Then, specific examples of advanced services (quantum imaging and holography; localization of the Internet of remote things) are discussed. The book is, therefore, intended to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G. © 2023 River Publishers. All rights reserved.}},

Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Identifying defects at different scales is a challenge in industrial defect detection. To solve this problem, many multi-scale feature fusion networks have been proposed to improve multi-scale target detection accuracy by fusing fine-grained information from shallow networks and semantic information from deep networks. This approach requires the introduction of extraÂ parameters. Thinking from another perspective, can the accuracy of multi-scale target detection be improved by fusing the feature information under different receptive fields? For this purpose, we designed a three-layer network structure called Trident-LK Net. our model uses convolutional kernels of different sizes (31, 25, 1) in the feature extraction phase and establishes cross-fusion connections. This omits the feature fusion part and greatly reduces the network parameters while obtaining a good detection accuracy. Finally we perform experiments on the neu-det dataset and the gc10 dataset to verify the feasibility of our idea. While keeping the number of parameters to a minimum, our model achieves competitive detection results on the neu-det dataset (76.9% mAP) and optimal on the gc10 dataset (63.55% mAP).

Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Personal health tracking devices and internet-based digital platforms with the capacity to collect, aggregate, and store data at massive scales are examples of tools that have broadened priorities in computing to include data science. In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand 'big data.' This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, 'Coding Like a Data Miner' (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of 'big data' sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {The goal of this research full paper is to provide insight into most recent findings of interviews with faculty members teaching digital skills in an integrated and innovative way embedded into courses on subject didactics of a teacher education program. Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future. © 2023 IEEE.}},

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct.

In this perspective, several factors have led to the development of tools to support programming disciplines, including: (i) the persistent problems in teaching programming worldwide, (ii) the inclusion of computational thinking and programming practices in the new Basic Education Curriculum in Brazil, (iii) the need for a lightweight virtual tool that can be freely shared and used, as many available tools charge fees, and (iv) the practical application of knowledge by licentiate degree students in Computer Science, encompassing both learning theories and software development, through the evaluation of the tool.

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education. © 2023 IEEE.}},

Furthermore, we argue that our model has the ability to derive mind functions such as dreams and thinking.

  abstract = {Aims and objectives/purpose/research questions: Using a foreign language is suggested to affect how we think, even reducing bias. However, the exact mechanisms of its influence are still unknown. In this project, we tested two variants of the “thinking more” mechanism driving the foreign language effect: increased cognitive reflection and greater task engagement. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed previously collected data from five experiments employing the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and/or the Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT), each administered in the native or foreign language. If the increased reflection explanation is true, the CRT score should be higher in participants using a foreign language. If the greater task engagement explanation is true, the BNT score should be higher in participants using a foreign language. Data and analysis: We report data from N = 1,288 participants who filled the CRT and N = 413 who filled the BNT. Data were analyzed using the NHST approach and its Bayesian alternative over a spectrum of liberal, default, and conservative priors. Data are publicly available at https://osf.io/m8tn9 Findings/conclusions: All the test results were nonsignificant and showed anecdotal to strong evidence that neither the CRT nor the BNT scores improved in the foreign language condition, also when controlling for proficiency. The proportion of intuitive to computational errors was also unaffected. Originality: We are the first to comprehensively test the thinking-more explanation of the foreign language effect. Significance/Implications: Our results undermine the claim that using a foreign language promotes more cognitive reflection or engagement. The foreign language effect likely has a different cause. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  year = {2023}},
  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1-5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1-5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model. © 2023 IEEE.}},

In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8-10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problems of small target and low recognition accuracy of high-speed railway contact network hanging chord defects, this paper proposes a target detection algorithm for hanging chord defects based on YOLOv5. To enhance the original YOLOv5 algorithm, the MobielNetv3 module was used as the efficient and lightweight backbone feature extraction network. Depth-separable convolution was adopted instead of standard convolution, reducing the number of network parameters by 2× 10 ^6 and increasing detection speed by 23%. Introducing BiFPN feature pyramid structure with fusion of different feature layers in neck network improves detection accuracy by 0.4%. Adding CBAM attention mechanism at the prediction end improves the feature extraction ability of the model for small target images, which further improves the detection accuracy by 0.5%. The loss function CIoU was improved to Focal EIoU in order to solve the problems of unbalanced sample datasets and vanishing IoU gradients during the training process. The experimental results exhibit that the improved algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 98.5% on the dataset, a 39% enchancment in model detection speed and a 28% reduction in model parameters, verifying that the algorithm has the advantages of high recognition accuracy and fast detection speed. It can effectively solve the technical difficulties in the detection of defects in the existing contact network suspension chords, and provides a new way of thinking for intelligent railway inspection.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students' learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one's working memory capacity. According to the research results, one's working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students' cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students' operation span and learning performance.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Software engineering for mobile applications has its own challenges, different from when we engineer software just for desktop environments. With the emergence of smart things (including smart everyday objects embedded with connectivity, computational ability, sensors, and sometimes actuators, urban robots such as delivery and cleaning robots, smart street lighting, smart vehicles, and smart park benches, and so on) not just within the home but in public spaces, there is a need to consider software engineering challenges for software on such things. Human-centred software engineering and work on ethical behaviours in smart things will need to come together, even as we continue to understand what it takes to effectively develop software (and systems) for such emerging devices. In order to demonstrate how software (and systems) for intelligent devices in public places might be developed, findings from a quantitative survey we performed are discussed in this study. The survey was designed such that the questions focused on the socio-ethical behaviours of smart devices when interacting with people in public places. The survey was based on a supermarket scenario where the participants had to answer the different questions in the questionnaire. There were 250 participants who only completed part of the survey; of them, 60 participants finished it in full. The complete replies have been examined and analysed in this paper. To determine how people feel about employing smart technology in public places, a variety of smart devices, including robots, smart cameras, smart speakers, and smart trolleys, are utilised in the survey questions. According to the findings, more than 80 percent of respondents think it important for smart gadgets to be socially-aware and ethical in public places.General Abstract This paper examines the survey results conducted to explore if smart devices such as robots or smart cameras can be deployed in public areas. The respondents reply to survey questions asking them whether they believe it is crucial to keep smart robots, smart carts, or any other smart devices in the supermarket. The survey's questions are constructed in such a manner that participants are asked to imagine themselves as either a customer shopping for groceries at a store or a manager running the business and dealing with the friendly robot. This survey was created with the intention of thinking carefully about how intelligent software systems may be designed from the standpoint of software engineering for public settings. Later in this article, the survey findings and insights are discussed.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

STEM incorporates an interdisciplinary approach that includes inquiry, analysis, critical thinking, practical experimentation, and cooperative problem-solving. Technological advancements are offering new ways to integrate new tools such as drones, robotics and gaming in teaching and learning practices and modify the pedagogical approaches that are more appealing and engaging. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical approach and practice that integrate drone technology and block-based programming to foster students' computation thinking in a STEM context. The block-based visual programming languages provide an interactive environment to connect the blocks and write programs. The study was conducted in six Australian schools. Students were assigned projects to automate drones using the DroneBlocks app and make programs to fly the drone in different geometrical patterns; straight line, arch, rectangle, triangles and zig-zag and integrate the various manoeuvres; bounce, 8D flips, and throw & go along flight paths. Students' computational thinking development was examined with an emphasis on their performance in formulating and problem-solving. Results have shown that integrated drone and programming pedagogy contributed significantly to students' learning of developing computational thinking for problem-solving and decomposing a problem into smaller parts in a sequence that includes mathematical algorithms to write programs.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence technology has made remarkable progress in machine learning, but it is still in its infancy in creative thinking or computational creativity. In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles. We plan to further use this model to address complex real-world problems, such as the study of cancer therapeutic targets. © 2023 IEEE.}},

The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework.

Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9-12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6-8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs.

  abstract = {In intelligent transportation systems, accurate long-term traffic forecasting is informative for administrators and travelers to make wise decisions in advance. Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the models' strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Humans have rich experience applying linear models and logical thinking, but only experts understand the behaviour of non-linear systems. However, the deep neural network (DNN) implementation of text non-linear systems outperforms optimal linear models. Therefore, the forward DNN (the pattern recognition system in this paper) attracts attention to the necessity of interpreting the results obtained by DNN. To preserve the high performance of DNN, we focus on a post-hoc explanation; this approach means building an explainable model for the decision obtained by the black box. To avoid the interpretation of a set of millions of non-linear functions, we divide DNN into two parts: the feature extractor and the classifier. Following that, we argue for a specific interpretation of each of them. While for classifiers, we have several suitable explainable models (and we decided on the fuzzy logical function), we believe that feature interpretation is a creative scientific activity corresponding to the usual research. The paper presents a tool to help researchers and users understand extracted features not necessarily known in the specific application domain. Explaining the new features offers a way to learn from computers.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study's findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This paper first presents an input-stationary (IS) implemented crossbar accelerator (INCA), supporting inference and training for deep neural networks (DNNs). Processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators for DNNs have been actively researched, specifically, with resistive random-access memory (RRAM), due to RRAM's computing and memorizing capabilities and device merits. To the best of our knowledge, all previous PIM accelerators have saved weights into RRAMs and inputs (activations) into conventional memories - it naturally forms weight-stationary (WS) dataflow. WS has generally been considered the most optimized choice for high parallelism and data reuse. How-ever, WS-based PIM accelerators show fundamental limitations: first, remaining high dependency on DRAM and buffers for fetching and saving inputs (activations); second, a remarkable number of extra RRAMs for transposed weights and additional computational intermediates in training; third, coarse-grained arrays demanding high-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and introducing poor utilization in depthwise and pointwise convolution; last, degraded accuracy due to its sensitivity to weights which are affected by RRAM's nonideality. On the other hand, we observe that IS dataflow, where RRAMs retain inputs (activations), can effectively address the limitations of WS, because of low dependency by only loading weights, no need for extra RRAMs, feasibility of fine-grained accelerator design, and less impact of input (activation) variance on accuracy. But IS dataflow is hardly achievable by the existing crossbar structure because it is difficult to implement kernel sliding and preserve the high parallelism. To support kernel movement, we constitute a cell structure with two-transistor-one-RRAM (2T1R). Based on the 2T1R cell, we design a novel three-dimensional (3D) architecture for high parallelism in batch training. Our experiment results prove the potential of INCA. Compared to the WS accelerator, INCA achieves up to 20.6× and 260× energy efficiency improvement in inference and training, respectively; 4.8× (inference) and 18.6× (training) speedup as well. While accuracy in WS drops to 15% in our high-noise simulation, INCA presents an even more robust result as 86% accuracy. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners' interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners' performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners' final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners' actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners' performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners' action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model. © 2013 IEEE.}},

In addition, the connection between this proposal and computational thinking is explored.

In addition, thanks to an evaluation of the behavior of the robot, identify the faults and apply the solution, as in the debugging process carried out in software programming. It should be added that BEAM robotics has a sustainable and low-cost aspect, which is used in learning activities where Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is recycled, and students are taught to value and integrate these parts into the design of the robots. A pre and post survey and a respective statistical analysis and evaluation of curricular activities are presented as evidence of the improvement observed in students’ STEM knowledge and skills.

It analyzes specific attributes of associative modeling, otherwise native to computational thinking, that contribute to the legibility of the design process. The paper demonstrates how associative modeling allows the design process to be examined and edited at any stage during and even after algorithmic development, bringing in flexibility.

We found that the impact on teachers mirrored impacts found on teachers who engage in Research Practice Partnerships, including increased self-efficacy, expanded professional networks, and changed classroom practices.Implications. By bringing researchers and educators together with a clear focus on equity-based problems of practice in CS education, the results display a multitude of positive impacts. Teachers indicate that they are are positively impacted, researchers develop a clear understanding of realistic practices, and students are peripherally impacted through changed practices in the classroom. Therefore, the most significant contribution to advance the disciplinary understanding is the potential for this new process to decrease the gap between research and practice.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

  abstract = {Millions of people around the world are affected by one or more mental disorders that interfere in their thinking and behavior. A timely detection of these issues is challenging but crucial, since it could open the possibility to offer help to people before the illness gets worse. One alternative to accomplish this is to monitor how people express themselves, that is for example what and how they write, or even a step further, what emotions they express in their social media communications. In this article, we analyze two computational representations that aim to model the presence and changes of the emotions expressed by social media users. In our evaluation we use two recent public data sets for two important mental disorders: Depression and Anorexia. The obtained results suggest that the presence and variability of emotions, captured by the proposed representations, allow to highlight important information about social media users suffering from depression or anorexia. Furthermore, the fusion of both representations can boost the performance, equalling the best reported approach for depression and barely behind the top performer for anorexia by only 1 percent. Moreover, these representations open the possibility to add some interpretability to the results.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Libraries as social spaces are bound to evolve based on a society’s level of civilisation and information media. This paper argues that the emergence of smart libraries have changed the paradigms of library by acknowledging the potential benefits and transformation smart library brings to library operations and services. It notes that analytical and computational thinking, data literacy, information literacy, social intelligence, programs and project management, cross-cultural competency, transliteracy, transdisciplinary, design thinking and mindset, virtual collaboration and cognitive load management are skills to be possessed by smart librarians. It highlights cloud computing, big data, 3D printing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, RFID, drones etc., as the emerging technologies used for smart libraries and further discusses smart services, smart people, smart places and smart governance as the dimensions of smart library. Revelations are further made that smart libraries aid space saving, expansion of library working hours and services and promotes access to information, while remarks are made that lack of technological know-how, technophobia, data privacy and security, etc., are the challenges of smart library. It concludes that the emergence of smart library have facilitated the redefinition of library services and operations and recommends amongst others that librarians should continuously update their skills so that they can meet up with competitions that may arise from the challenges of globalisation of the information landscape. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It is an annual competition designed to showcase college students' innovative ability, team spirit and ability to write programs, and analyze and solve problems under pressure. Aiming at the main problems existing in traditional C++ curriculum teaching, a live code teaching method and an ACM/ICPC innovation model are proposed in this paper that highlights the "student-centered"teaching concept. By taking the "problem-solving"as the main line of teaching, the "live code"as the teaching method, and the informatization teaching as the means, the ACM/ICPC competition promotes the integration of the students' theory and practice. The results of more than ten years of practical teaching show that the proposed live code pedagogy and the ACM/ICPC-based reform have effectively cultivated the students' programming interest and computational thinking, and significantly improved their programming and innovation abilities. At present, the live code teaching method and the ACM/ICPC innovation model have been effectively promoted and applied in the three campuses of our university, as they have a certain leading and exemplary role in cultivating strong professional programming skills, computational thinking, global vision and the all-round development of top-notch innovative talents in the computer field.  © 2022 ACM.}},

The students had experienced popular speech recognition usage in their daily life, such as Siri and Google Assistant; therefore, this study developed instructional material for university freshmen to learn to develop their own artificial intelligence (AI) application (app) on a smart phone with PAC in MIT App Inventor. The PAC platform and the learning material cultivated students to train their own voice classification model, which is a form of supervised machine learning in the AI domain. The results showed that both groups, who had successfully trained computers to distinguish received voice commands with PAC receiving the human voice spectrogram via the cloud platform developed by MIT, made significant progress in their learning effectiveness in AI education. When the students employed the AI app on smartphones in the CT board game, the students’ voice commands could be classified, and then the corresponding command could be executed through the program to control the action of the robot car on the map, regardless of whether they were competing or not. This study not only successfully provided the students with simple AI learning material, but also cultivated their creative thinking, as identified in the survey of the computational thinking self-efficacy scale. During the process of completing a mobile phone application with AI, students should know and use the function of voice classification to achieve goals and expand their cognition of AI applications. This study concluded that the AI learning material for general students rather than students in the department of computer science facilitated the students’ engagement. © 2022, The Author(s).}},

Currently, there is a lack of such assessments in upper primary school. That is why we present the development and validation of the competent CT test (cCTt), an unplugged CT test targeting 7–9 year-old students. In the first phase, 37 experts evaluated the validity of the cCTt through a survey and focus group. In the second phase, the test was administered to 1519 students. We employed Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to assess the instruments’ psychometric properties. The expert evaluation indicates that the cCTt shows good face, construct, and content validity. Furthermore, the psychometric analysis of the student data demonstrates adequate reliability, difficulty, and discriminability for the target age groups. Finally, shortened variants of the test are established through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. To conclude, the proposed cCTt is a valid and reliable instrument, for use by researchers and educators alike, which expands the portfolio of validated CT assessments across compulsory education. Future assessments looking at capturing CT in a more exhaustive manner might consider combining the cCTt with other forms of assessments. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

While many studies embed computation in one discipline, few include projects that substantively involve many disciplines. We conducted a mixed methods case study with a sequential design to explore adolescents’ self-efficacy and engagement in computational practices, along with practices in several disciplines of science and engineering. In partnership with two eighth-grade environmental science teachers in a culturally and linguistically diverse urban-ring city of the Northeast US, students (N = 199) worked in teams to design, assemble, and code for “smart”, or automated, miniature greenhouses. We report on successes in engagement, along with tensions in self-efficacy, namely relating to generality, social factors, and emotive sources. Specifically, we elaborate on tensions related to (1) engagement via fun and camaraderie vs. disaffection per anxiety and stress; (2) practices as sequential vs. simultaneous; (3) prior experience with coding vs. present application; and (4) disciplinary pre-conceptions vs. expansion. We conclude with implications for educational design of pluridisciplinary spaces, especially for those including computation, and which seek to leverage interest and engagement to develop self-efficacy. Also, we discuss how our study extends self-efficacy theory through its finer-grained analyses with more diverse participants. Ultimately, our work builds on and extends current educational designs for embedding computational practices in required, non-CS classes, a vital concern for adolescents’ present and future civic participation, in personal, social, and professional ways. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

The aim of this exploratory study is to evaluate the learning outcomes of this CT integrated lesson and students' attitudes towards such a lesson. For this purpose, students' exit tickets, feedback forms, supervisor observations and interviews with students have been analyzed. This qualitative analysis revealed that students perceived the lesson as difficult, especially during the Modify and Create phases. In addition, the results suggest that all phases are dependent on taking enough time to finish the Use phase to get familiar with the computational steps. Several suggestions have been given to improve the lesson, for instance, to use a simpler topic of economics.

Drawing on two strands of contemporary thinking about glitches as systemic design features of digital systems and as generative fissures within them, we mobilize a queer orientation that stays with the generative tensions of urban spatialities that present as idiosyncratic and as interrupting. We mobilize this epistemological approach through illustrative U.S. based examples of seemingly abandoned shared e-bikes, performatively ‘ugly’ homes, and wilful property dilapidation wrought through the registers of desire and aesthetics. In so doing, we show how glitch empistemologies render visible how the technocapitalist manufacturing of normative spatial desires for particular kinds of urban sociospatialities and aesthetic visual signatures are both secured and interrupted on digitally-mediated and -mediatized terrains.

In parallel, both the close contact with computers allows the development of skills such as logical reasoning, critical thinking, creativity, communication and teamwork, and the very coexistence of citizens with digital technologies requires the prior acquisition of this knowledge, in order to be prepared to meet the new demands of modern society. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an ongoing research project that aims at developing young children’s expression through embodied computing in order to enhance their digital knowledge, by adapting the digital manipulative (DM) Mobeybou for storytelling and narrative creation as a tool for promoting computational thinking (CT) and inherent competences through a bodily expression experience.

For their runtime quality optimization, however, current approaches cannot tackle the variations of quality modeling and harvested energy simultaneously. Therefore, in this article, we are the first to propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) method that optimizes the application execution quality of energy harvesting edge devices to mitigate the variations. First, we propose a baseline DRL formulation that novelly migrates the objective of quality maximization into a reward function and constructs a DRL quality agent. Second, we devise a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based selector that performs DRL quality agent selection based on the energy harvesting history. Third, we further propose two optimization methods to alleviate the nonnegligible overhead of DRL computations: 1) an improved thinking-while-moving concurrent DRL scheme to compromise the 'state drifting' issue during the DRL decision process and 2) a variable interstate duration decision scheme that compromises the DVFS overhead incurred in each action taken. The experiments take an adaptive stereo matching application as a case study. The results show that the proposed DRL-based DVFS method on average achieves 17.9% runtime reduction and 22.05% quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art solutions.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.}},

Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Skylight polarized patterns provide fresh thinking for the human to use the information sources in nature for orientation, but this orientation method is susceptible to weather conditions. Especially, in the case of cloudy weather, the cloud directly leads to the decline of orientation precision. In this article, a robust bionic polarized skylight orientation method based on the model consistency of polarization patterns (MCOPPs) is proposed for cloudy weather. First, we made full use of the DOP information to preprocess the polarization information as an aid to the subsequent polarization light orientation. Then, based on the vertical feature of the E-vector of the polarized light and the scattering plane, we developed the MCOPP error criterion and proposed a two-step optimizing framework for the effective selection of the interior points. Finally, the outdoor static rotating experiment and the dynamic vehicle experiment are conducted for evaluating our algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that MCOPP can realize an effective and robust polarized orientation under cloudy conditions, and the accuracy of orientation in the outdoor static experiment is within 0.5° and in the dynamic car experiment is within 0.7°. Compared with the other four classic methods, the RMSE of the orientation error can be decreased by 50.6% in the outdoor static experiment and by 46.0% in the dynamic vehicle experiment. Especially, the proposed MCOPP has lower computational complexity than the existing robust polarized skylight method.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.}},

However, the successful injection of computation thinking in formal educational settings demands the construction of developmentally appropriate assessment tools. In this paper, we discuss a novel framework for assessing computational thinking skills in early childhood settings. The proposed framework was employed in a relevant quantitative research study conducted in the city of Heraklion, Crete, from February to June 2019, with a sample of 435 first and second graders and within the context of the Environmental Study course. This paper also provides evidence regarding the examination of age, gender, and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course as predictive factors of one of the core computational thinking competencies, namely algorithmic thinking. The research findings revealed that age and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course constitute predictive factors for algorithmic thinking skills in the first and second grade level of primary school. On the contrary, algorithmic thinking skills are not related to first and second graders’ gender.

A total of 35 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis with a total of 49 independent effect sizes. The meta-Analysis results showed that the current K-12 teaching has a moderate positive impact on the development of students' computational thinking (g=0.548). Pair programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning have the most significant effects, which are more helpful in cultivating students' computational thinking. Moreover, we analyzed the impact of moderator variables on the relationship between K-12 teaching and computational thinking. Findings revealed that the effects of CT education were more substantial (a) for middle school students than for primary school students, (b) in interdisciplinary courses than in computer science courses, (c) with collaborative learning activities than with individual learning activities. Based on this, we suggest that paired programming, unplugged activities, and project-based learning, which are based on collaborative learning, should be used more for CT education. In addition, schools should develop interdisciplinary courses to promote computational thinking migration in different disciplines.  © 2022 ACM.}},

  journal = {ACM International Conference Proceeding Series}},
  abstract = {Computational thinking is increasingly introduced at primary school level, usually with some form of programming activity. In particular, educational robots provide an opportunity for engaging students with programming through hands-on experiences. However, primary school teachers might not be adequately prepared for teaching computer science related topics, and giving feedback to students can often be challenging: Besides the content of the feedback (e.g., what problems have to be handled), the way the feedback is given is also important, as it can lead to negative emotional effects. To support teachers with the way of giving feedback on common problems when teaching programming with robotics, we conducted a study consisting of seven workshops with three third and four fourth grade primary school classes. Within seven different activities, the 116 primary school children first programmed the Ozobot Evo robot in the pen-and-paper mode and then on a digital device. Throughout these activities we collected data on the problems the students encountered, the feedback given, and the fun they experienced. Our analysis reveals eight categories of problems, which we summarise in this paper together with corresponding possible feedback. We observed that problems that are urgent or can harm the students' self-efficacy have a negative impact on how enjoyable an activity is perceived. While direct instruction significantly decreased the experienced fun, hints had a positive effect. Generally, we found programming the Ozobot Evo to be encouraging for both girls and boys. To support teachers, we discuss ideas for giving encouraging feedback on common problems of Ozobot Evo programming activities and how our findings transfer to other robots.  © 2022 ACM.}},

The field of computer science offers a variety of models that can visualize states, as well as processes and, are therefore very suitable for the different areas of language teaching (e.g., reading, writing, grammar-, or vocabulary acquisition). With CS modeling as a teaching and learning strategy, two main objectives are addressed: enhancing learning and retention and fostering computational thinking skills. This paper presents best practice examples on how to meet these two objectives as well as the results of a crossover study, where we investigated whether vocabulary acquisition is facilitated when it is thematically preorganized in class diagrams. The results illustrate that pupils who studied with the class diagram strategy had significantly higher recall performance than pupils who studied with the list of words.

The results showed that both student-selected grouping and heterogeneous grouping can improve the learning outcome. The learning outcome with student-selected grouping is business management background > other backgrounds > design background > electrical engineering and computer science background. With heterogeneous grouping, the learning outcome of the design background is close to that of the electrical engineering and computer science background, and there is no significant difference among electrical engineering and computer science, business management, and other learning backgrounds.

  abstract = {Today's teaching and didactical methods are trying more and more to integrate digital technologies and computational thinking (CT) into other subjects. One way of combining and integrating these important skills and CT into all subjects, school levels, and school types is to include the game Poly-Universe (PolyUni). According to the results of the Poly-Universe in School Education (PUSE) study 2018, the game can be expected to have a positive effect on visual perceptual progress, including isolation and the development of shape-background skills. So far, however, comparatively few attempts have been made to explore the educational possibilities of PolyUni for different school levels and subjects, besides mathematics. This research explores how PolyUni can be used to promote CT and to evaluate whether the learning objectives in the subjects of physical education and biology have been achieved. Furthermore, it examines how PolyUni combines the requirements of the different curricula in secondary school, based on self-designed tasks. Additionally, further aspects PolyUni can promote besides the curriculum in secondary school are discussed. To explore the above-mentioned aspects, a mixed-methods study methodology was used. The participant observation method was employed for qualitative data collection, and a self-designed assessment grid and additional picture analysis were used for the quantitative data. The game was utilized in two workshops for biology and physical education at an Austrian secondary school, and fifty-six students were observed and analyzed. Based on the present data, it can be assumed that PolyUni helps to achieve the requirements of the curricula and pre-defined teaching and learning objectives in a playful way. Furthermore, the game not only promotes CT in secondary school but also encourages enjoyment and collaboration between peers in biology and physical education lessons.  © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking has become pervasive across many technical and creative disciplines. Creating a computationally literate workforce capable of recognizing and eliminating algorithmic discrimination requires diverse perspectives and lived experiences. Your Voice is Power is a 5-class period curriculum targeted for K-12 audiences that seeks to promote racial equity and increase interest in computing careers by integrating elements of computing, music, social justice, and entrepreneurship. Centering around the song “Entrepreneur” by Pharrell Williams, students engage in lyrical analysis to extract and explore themes of social justice using the OUTKAST Imagination framework. Students then engage with musical concepts from a computing perspective and implement them using EarSketch, a web-based, learn-to-code through music remixing platform developed at Georgia Tech. In this paper, we present a description of the Your Voice is Power Curriculum and results from an evaluation study. The curriculum overview includes a description of the content and activities, as well as a discussion of the frameworks and theories underlying the curriculum's development. We also present results from a program evaluation covering both a pilot and a full implementation of this newly developed curriculum during the 2020-2021 academic year. Participating high school students and teachers were recruited to respond to online surveys regarding their awareness of and interest in computing, music, and social justice, and their experiences in the competition. Teachers felt that competition participation conferred a variety of benefits to their students and expressed positive attitudes around the social justice focus of the curriculum. Students provided largely positive feedback on the competition and reported a positive impact on their understanding of social justice and equity. Students also demonstrated high levels of understanding of the ubiquity of coding skills and applications. Taken together, program evaluation results show that this integration of themes is effective in engaging students in difficult conversations about race while building interest in computing. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.}},

  abstract = {Computing education practitioners and researchers know a lot about how to design courses for students who are going to pursue a career in computing (e.g., professional software developer, data scientist, or computer engineer). Today, computing is a necessary part of other careers, such as scientists who create computational models and simulations, artists working in computational media, and critical computing scholars. The University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) charged a task force with defining the computing education needs for their students. The task force conducted a year long process involving searches of courses and programs, interviews with students and faculty, and a large survey. The task force proposed themes of Computing for Discovery, Expression, and Justice as useful in organizing computing within the liberal arts and sciences. We are now designing the introductory courses for expression and justice. We are using participatory design methods where faculty advisors engage in tasks (like card sorting) to define projects and learning goals. The expression and justice card sorts are markedly different. We are planning to use a block-based language (Snap!) for instruction and homework, but students will also engage with a purpose-built Runestone ebook in a textual language like Processing (for expression), and Python and HTML (for justice). The ebook activities are informed by purpose-first programming in order to support transfer of knowledge and to encourage a sense of self-efficacy and authenticity. © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Broadening participation in computer science (CS) for primary/elementary students is a growing movement, spurred by computing workforce demands and the need for younger students to develop skills in problem solving and critical/computational thinking. However, offering computer science instruction at this level is directly related to the availability of teachers prepared to teach the subject. Unfortunately, there are relatively few primary/elementary school teachers who have received formal training in computer science, and they often self-report a lack of CS subject matter expertise. Teacher development is a key factor to address these issues, and this paper describes professional development strategies and empirical impacts of a summer institute that included two graduate courses and a series of Saturday workshops during the subsequent academic year. Key elements included teaching a high-level programing language (Python and JavaScript), integrating CS content and pedagogy instruction, and involving both experienced K-12 CS teachers and University faculty as instructors. Empirical results showed that this carefully structured PD that incorporated evidence-based elements of sufficient duration, teacher active learning and collaboration, modeling, practice, and feedback can successfully impact teacher outcomes. Results showed significant gains in teacher CS knowledge (both pedagogy and content), self-efficacy, and perception of CS value. Moderating results - examining possible differential effects depending on teacher gender, years of teaching CS, and geographic locale - showed that the PD was successful with experienced and less experienced teachers, with teachers from both rural and urban locales, and with both males and females.  © 2022 ACM.}},

  journal = {Textile Research Journal}},
  abstract = {The design of metallic card clothing, which is one of the most important devices in the textile industry, has always been based on operational experience. With the development of types of fibers and the requirements for the quality of yarns, those principles concluded by engineers seem to be losing their efficiency. Recent research found that airflow played an important role in the card process, which means airflow should be carefully studied. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation greatly helps in the analysis of airflow because the gauge between carding elements is too narrow to put in any measuring device. In the present study, with the help of CFD simulation, the air around different carding clothing with varied tooth depth was analyzed. It was concluded that the carding efficiency improvement in card clothing with lower tooth depth may be related to more concentrated air velocity at the tooth tips. This resulted in more probabilities that fibers would get through the cylinder surface at the teeth tips, so that the fibers could be caught by flat-top needles more efficiently. With this assumption, a new generation of card clothing called “double teeth” containing two teeth in a single section has been invented. The new configuration design of card clothing was then applied in several spinning mills on an industrial scale for experiments. The results showed about a 30% improvement in production at the same quality level as conventional card clothing, which implied the usefulness of the newly applied principles related to airflow. Despite the difficulty in the study of the complex carding process, the new airflow analysis method has shown an optional and worthwhile way of thinking that could make a difference in future research in the textile industry. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has proposed a revised primary mathematics curriculum with an emphasis on CT skills and problem solving, and some teachers would like to introduce it already on an informal basis. However, CT is not yet part of teacher training. Our motivating question has been: how can teachers without a computer science background deliver CT at primary level in Ireland? Our process involves third-level computer science academics co-creating resources with in-service and pre-service teachers during workshops. The resources comprise a workbook and lesson plans. Our resources are based on tasks from the International Bebras Challenge, a well-known large-scale international CT contest with a reasonably gender-neutral profile of school-age participants. The workbook consists of ten Bebras tasks, each followed by a page of original activities on the theme of the task. A set of ten lesson plans accompanies the workbook. Each lesson plan has information about how to use the corresponding workbook activities in the classroom, where the activity might fit into the existing curriculum, categorisation of the task in terms of eight CT topics, differentiation, and extension activities.

Results indicated that the children aged 6–8 years old could classify things according to two kinds of criteria at the same time, but their cognitive style was still ego-centered and they found it difficult to deal with problems from a third-party perspective, no matter whether in the treatment group or the control group. However, students in the treatment group achieved significantly higher scores on the test of computational thinking and were more engaged in the classroom interaction patterns. These findings provide evidence of the positive effect of the UPTA on promoting children’s computational thinking by guiding them to decompose and solve problems, as well as enhancing their interaction and communication in the classroom, so as to transform from simple imitation to collaborative inquiry. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

With increasing efforts to bring computing education opportunities into elementary schools, there is a growing need for assessments, with arguments for validity, to support research evaluation at these grade levels. After successfully piloting a 10-question computational thinking assessment (Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students - ACES) for 4th graders in Spring 2020, we used our analyses of item difficulty and discrimination to iterate on the assessment. Objectives. To increase the number of potential items for ACES, we created isomorphic versions of existing questions. The nature of the changes varied from incidental changes that we did not believe would impact student performance to more radical changes that seemed likely to influence question difficulty. We sought to understand the impact of these changes on student performance. Method. Using these isomorphic questions, we created two versions of our assessment and piloted them in Spring 2021 with 235 upper-elementary (4th grade) students. We analyzed the reliability of the assessments using Cronbach's alpha. We used Chi-squared tests to analyze questions that were identical across the two assessments to form a baseline of comparison and then ran Chi-Squared and Kruskal-Wallis H tests to analyze the differences between the isomorphic copies of the questions. Findings. Both assessment versions demonstrated good reliability, with identical Cronbach's alphas of 0.868. We found statistically similar performance on the identical questions between our two groups of students, allowing us to compare their performance on the isomorphic questions. Students performed differently on the isomorphic questions, indicating the changes to the questions had a differential impact on student performance. Implications. This paper builds on existing work by presenting methods for creating isomorphic questions. We provide valuable lessons learned, both on those methods and on the impact of specific types of changes on student performance.  © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Active student engagement, teaching via experience in real-life settings and learning by doing, are pedagogical strategies appropriate to improve student-reasoning skills. By building models, performing investigations, examining and explaining experimental results, using theoretical and computational thinking, constructing representations, undergraduates can acquire a deeper understanding of fundamental disciplinary concepts while reinforcing transversal abilities. In this framework, Engineering courses should be designed with the final objective to develop practical skills, focusing on hands-on activities. This contribution presents two different inquiry-based learning environments recently experienced at the University of Palermo in the context of bioelectronic and biomedical Engineering. The first study describes a laboratory activity about digital ophthalmologic signal classification; the second laboratory focuses on the analysis of the prefrontal cortex activation during a memory task using functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We introduce and discuss the learning workshops, with the research objective of improving current instruction and training in Engineering courses. Indeed, this contribution aims to suggest a conceptual framework in the form of a structured elective suite of modules tailored to meet the needs of Engineering graduates. The outcomes of both studies seem to highlight that self-directed learning activities could enhance students’ enthusiasm to learn and engagement in engineering investigations, contributing to improve the achievements of students and acquire a more effective learning approach. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {As a dynamic and multifaceted construct, computational thinking (CT) has proven to be challenging to conceptualize and assess, which impedes the development of a workable ontology framework. To address this issue, the current article describes a novel approach towards understanding the ontological aspects of CT by using text mining and graph-theoretic techniques to elucidate teachers’ perspectives collected in an online survey (N = 105). In particular, a hierarchical cluster analysis, a knowledge representation method, was applied to identify sub-groups in CT conceptualization and assessment amongst teachers. Five clusters in conceptualization and two clusters in assessment were identified; several relevant and distinct themes were also extracted. The results suggested that teachers attributed CT as a competence domain, relevant in the problem- solving context, as well as applicable and transferrable to various disciplines. The results also shed light on the importance of using multiple approaches to assess the diversity of CT. Overall, the findings collectively contributed to a comprehensive and multi-perspective representation of CT that refine both theory and practice. The methodology employed in this article has suggested a minor but significant step towards addressing the quintessential questions of “what is CT?” and “how is it evidenced?”. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students' CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third-and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students' CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants' (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students' CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs.

  abstract = {This paper presents the use of a computational design algorithm in combination with robotic fabrication and sensing to augment the design and construction process for non-standardized material. Although reusing reclaimed material can significantly reduce the environmental impact in building construction, current design processes are not set up for this shift in thinking. Contrary to conventional practices, designing within the constraints of available material means that geometry and topology cannot be fully pre-determined. This paper introduces a design methodology for corrugated shell structures from folded sheet metal of variable geometries and properties, in which the design goal adapts to available material. It follows a two-fold approach of digital algorithm development and scanning and physical prototyping for robotic fabrication. The scanned materials database is classified based on object geometry data and material properties; such as thickness, type of metal, and spring-back values for fabrication purposes. Together with a target surface, it is an input for a generative design algorithm consisting of surface generation and optimization. The surface generation tries to approximate the target through a translation of search algorithm results for object placement into a 2D mesh graph which is then linked to 3D particle spring based form-finding. The optimization consists of evaluation of structural, fabrication, and design criteria, with finally user selection. Robotic fabrication included object recognition, metal sheet folding and consideration of different metal spring back behavior. These methods were tested on a single curved arch surface and applied to a double curved cantilever canopy as a final demonstrator. The algorithm results showed a generation of different corrugated shell topologies based on iterated object placement. As a demonstrator, a part of the selected canopy was robotically fabricated from local industrial leftovers. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

Hence, the meaning of abstraction in the context of computational thinking is often confounded, as researchers interpret abstraction through diverse lenses. To disentangle these conceptual threads and gain insight into the operationalisation of abstraction, a systematic review of 96 empirical studies was undertaken. Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner’s activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation. The need to empirically validate emerging models and the implications for future research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Background: There has been a dearth of research on intersectional identities in STEM, including the fields of computing and engineering. In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly lowincome, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semistructured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls' self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation.  © Teachers College 2022.}},

Our hypothesis is that the PFC detects the hierarchical structure in temporal sequences in the shape of ordinal patterns and uses them to index information hierarchically in different parts of the brain. Henceforth, we propose that this mechanism for detecting ordinal patterns participates also in the hierarchical organization of the brain during development; i.e., the bootstrapping of the connectome. By doing so, it gives the tools to the language-ready brain for manipulating abstract knowledge and for planning temporally ordered information; i.e., the emergence of causality and symbolic thinking. In this position paper, we will review several neural models from the literature that support serial ordering and propose an original one.

Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

For the integration of CT into science instruction to be successful, teachers need to be able to communicate clearly what CT is and how it is defined through precise language. The intention of this poster is to explore the meaning of CT at the elementary level through a critical review of literature, analysis of standards, value-mapping across multiple stakeholders, analysis of written responses from elementary teachers on a CT survey, and deep discussions of a Design-Based Implementation Research Team (DBIR). The data collected and analyzed from these sources was combined to develop a definition of CT that would support implementation of CT for elementary teachers. © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

Computational thinking has attracted much interest and debatably ranks in importance with the time-honoured literacy skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, learning interventions in this subject have modelled computational thinking differently. We conducted a systematic review of 81 empirical studies to examine the nature, explicitness, and patterns of definitions of computational thinking. Data analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies operationalised computational thinking as a composite of programming concepts and preferred definitions from assessment-based frameworks. On the other hand, a substantial number of the studies did not establish the meaning of computational thinking when theorising their interventions nor clearly distinguish between computational thinking and programming. Based on these findings, this article proposes a model of computational thinking that focuses on algorithmic solutions supported by programming concepts which advances the conceptual clarity between computational thinking and programming. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

A total of 158 junior high school students and one teacher participated in the study over 5 months. The sample students were divided into four experimental groups in four single or combined programming approaches (i.e., plugged-in, unplugged, unplugged first, and plugged-in first) and one control group without programming. Data sources included the results of four CT tests, as well as interviews with the teacher and surveys with 24 representative participants. The results showed that the four programming approaches can effectively improve students’ CT skills and can be retained after two months. Among them, the form of implementing unplugged activities before plugged-in can most effectively improve CT skills, and can better weaken the impact of previous programming experience. Finally, the qualitative analysis results provided insights into the process of programming and CT education. These findings will provide implications for the introduction of CT in junior high school, and help expand students’ participation in computing. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

Our long-term goal is to alleviate this difficulty via pedagogical agents that can monitor the student interaction with the environment, detect when the student needs help and provide personalized support accordingly. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation of one such agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT environment. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make less errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Based on these results, we provide insights on how to improve the delivery of the agent's interventions in free-form GD environments.  © 2022 ACM.}},

  journal = {IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing}},
  abstract = {We study a distributed machine learning problem carried out by an edge server and multiple agents in a wireless network. The objective is to minimize a global function that is a sum of the agents' local loss functions. And the optimization is conducted by analog over-the-air model training. Specifically, each agent modulates its local gradient onto a set of waveforms and transmits to the edge server simultaneously. From the received analog signal the edge server extracts a noisy aggregated gradient which is distorted by the channel fading and interference, and uses it to update the global model and feedbacks to all the agents for another round of local computing. Since the electromagnetic interference generally exhibits a heavy-tailed intrinsic, we use the alpha-stable distribution to model its statistic. In consequence, the global gradient has an infinite variance that hinders the use of conventional techniques for convergence analysis that rely on second-order moments' existence. To circumvent this challenge, we take a new route to establish the analysis of convergence rate, as well as generalization error, of the algorithm. We also show that the training algorithm can be run in tandem with the momentum scheme to accelerate the convergence. Our analyses reveal a two-sided effect of the interference on the overall training procedure. On the negative side, heavy tail noise slows down the convergence rate of the model training: the heavier the tail in the distribution of interference, the slower the algorithm converges. On the positive side, heavy tail noise has the potential to increase the generalization power of the trained model: the heavier the tail, the better the model generalizes. This perhaps counterintuitive conclusion implies that the prevailing thinking on interference - that it is only detrimental to the edge learning system - is outdated and we shall seek new techniques that exploit, rather than simply mitigate, the interference for better machine learning in wireless networks.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.}},

Teachers' intuitive perspectives about optimal learning processes – "folk psychology" – impact their perspectives about teaching "folk pedagogy" and play a significant role in integrating educational technologies, such as visual programming, within the formal curriculum. This study was conducted based on the mixed method research paradigm. First, a folk pedagogy questionnaire was distributed to 89 teachers who integrate differing technologies in their classroom in order to identify the teachers' pedagogical perspectives: constructivist versus instructivist. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 teachers who teach Scratch in order to gain a deeper understanding of their instructivist/constructivist perspectives and actual pedagogical practices and strategies. Finally, we analyzed 96 students' programming artifacts to explore differences, if any, in students' outcomes related to the pedagogical perspectives of their teachers. Findings revealed that pedagogical perspectives are reflected in teaching strategies and assessment practices employed in a visual programming environment. It is promising that teaching visual programming promoted constructivist pedagogy even among instructivist teachers and was consequently reflected in student perspectives and expressed in their programming artifacts. We discuss theoretical and educational implications of these findings. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant interest among many educators around the globe. Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students’ CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students’ understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

The results lead us to extend Scratch with gameful PPP functionality focused on individual computational thinking (CT) concepts. In this paper, we vary elements of PPPs presented to 624 adult learners to identify those yielding manageable cognitive load (CL), and maximum CT motivation and learning efficiency, for a general populace. Findings indicate PPPs with feedback and without distractors limit CL, those with feedback produce highest CT motivation, and those with an isolated block palette and without distractors produce highest CT learning efficiency.

  abstract = {Engaging teachers in research has been shown to increase their self-efficacy and other factors related to increasing students' learning and growth. In this project, we partnered education researchers with computer science (CS) middle school teachers in the U.S. to develop a set of equity-focused teacher practice briefs that address a problem of practice that the teachers experience in their classrooms. Using a prescribed development process previously developed by Bell and Rhinehart (2016) for creating these briefs, teacher involved in the process saw their self-efficacy, professional networks and pedagogical content knowledge with respect to equity increase. The process allowed educators to reflect on their understanding of their particular problems of practice, while also collaboratively with expert researchers in the field to interpret previously published research results. The teachers and researcher teams created three briefs for the broader community to use. Throughout this four-month process, we learned how to improve the format for our particular needs, which included ensuring all voices were heard and equity was at the forefront of the work. In this experience report, we detail the process we used and report on lessons learned about the process from the teachers and researchers who participated. We also provide recommendations for others interested in using this method to engage in-service or pre-service teachers.  © 2022 ACM.}},

Due to the large number of students, it is impractical for instructors to manually assess all the work of each student to provide tailored feedback. We design and implement Automatic Programming Coach (AP-Coach), a web-based tool for automatically generating formative feedback for exercises on basic programming concepts. AP-Coach combines software engineering techniques (code similarity measures based on abstract syntax trees, and unit testing), and AI techniques (machine translation) in a novel manner to provide relevant feedback. We report promising results for AP-Coach in the following aspects: 1) quantitative evaluation of code similarity computation and machine translation, 2) qualitative evaluation of the perceived quality and usability of auto-generated feedback, and 3) experience of a selected group of computing students using the system.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {A prior study developed the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) for assessing individuals’ computational thinking dispositions in five dimensions: decomposition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, evaluation, and generalization. This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {This study reports a pre-college initiative that aims to integrate computational thinking (CT) in an integrated STEM learning environment in community centers' after-school programs for upper-level elementary school students. The initiative takes a collaborative approach that engages a range of stakeholders including higher institution's STEM educational researchers and disciplinary experts, a school district, three community centers and their satellite campus that serve Title I schools, and both in-service and pre-service teachers to develop and implement an integrated 'STEM + CT' curriculum. The design and development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum was guided by project-based learning (PBL) that engages students in sustained project-based activities and requires students to apply multiple STEM content knowledge and skills to solve a problem, in after-school programs where they enjoy large blocks of dedicated time to learn and practice CT and STEM. The implementation of the curriculum was led by in-service teachers in community centers' after-school programs who serve as facilitators and learners, and bring a depth of pedagogical knowledge, and who also benefit from such sustained interactions. This collaborative initiative brings relevant stakeholders together and helps build a researcher-practitioner partnership that aims to design, study, improve, and scale innovations in teaching and learning, which facilities the solving of a shared challenge of educational practice - how to integrate CT in K-12 STEM learning? - in this study. Lessons learned from the collaborative process are also discussed.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

Students might not be able to focus on learning mathematics now that writing a program might be difficult for them due to debugging. In this paper, mathematics curricula that meet math standards are developed with a block-based programming platform, Roboblocky. Linkbots are utilized as robots in the curricula to teach and learn mathematics in school settings. Students learn mathematics by observing the motions of robots in simulations or on real mats. Most students improved greatly in mathematics after using the curricula.

  abstract = {Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects' attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Nowadays, there has been a rapid evolution and transformation of technology. Many innovative technologies have emerged including artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, automation systems, quantum computing, big data, blockchain, etc. These emerging technologies have also transformed our lifestyles. This transformation has then inevitably required a new set of skills; Computational Thinking/Logical Thinking which can be compiled into Coding skills. Several novel educational media and teaching materials have been promoted. Current educational kits in the market can be classified into 3 main categories. These structures vary from physical kits vs virtual kits vs hybrid kits, while coding styles vary from block-based vs text-based. This paper presents an educational multi-purpose kit for coding and robotic design which has a hybrid kits structure with block-based coding style. Its connection scheme has been designed as wired/wireless plug-and-play via magnetic. The implemented prototype could be resilient for various learning activities, including emulating three (touch, hearing and sight) out of five basic human senses via sensors and actuators. A use case on shape recognition, using computer vision, has been illustrated to show how the implemented system works.  © 2022 Asia-Pacific of Signal and Information Processing Association (APSIPA).}},

  abstract = {Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi's overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This Innovative-Practice Full Paper presents the curriculum development of an introductory course in programming and data science for postdoctoral researchers (PDRs) in the biosciences. The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education. © 2022 IEEE.}},

For this purpose, an onion-ring system called COSSOL has been built in a case study for Twitter, following a hybrid approach to integrate Machine Learning classifiers and structural metrics from Computational Linguistics and Computational Sociology disciplines, respectively. The paper designs two experimentation scenarios divided into cases of collective subjectivity analysis for Colombia under different levels of communities' granularity. The first case validates the system by performing a cointegration test on the metrics of each construct for the onion rings' communities. The results show that some communities better propagate their subjective expressions against the disclosed topic when they have a higher network density and a common polarity. Moreover, the most stable communities in polarity towards a topic are those whose members are highly connected. Conversely, communities with a higher centrality index in a subset of members do not exhibit stability in collective subjectivity towards a topic disclosed in that community. The second case validates the model with a series of Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics with a polarity layer to describe the second onion ring subcommunities and their temporal variation through community recalculation. The results show no polar distributions similar to the bimodal ones representing consensus in the values of the common Thinking Acting and Feeling (TAF) forms. In addition, general negative sentiment is identified for the ten most representative nodes of the subcommunities analyzed.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students' culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All.

  abstract = {Filled pauses (or fillers) are the most common form of speech disfluencies and they can be recognized as hesitation markers ('um', 'uh' and 'er') made by speakers, usually to gain extra time while thinking their next words. Filled pauses are very frequent in spontaneous speech. Their detection is therefore rather important for two basic reasons: (a) their existence influences the performance of individual components, like Automatic Speech Recognition system (ASR), in human-machine interaction and (b) their frequency can characterize the overall speech quality of a particular speaker, as it can be strongly associated with the speaker's confidence. Despite that, only limited work has been published for the detection of filled pauses in speech, especially through audio. In this work, we propose a framework for filled pause detection using both audio and textual information. For the audio modality, we transfer knowledge from a plethora of supervised tasks, such as emotion or speaking rate, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For the text modality, we develop a temporal Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method that takes into account textual information derived from an ASR system. In addition, the proposed transfer learning approach for the audio classifier leads to better results when benchmarked on our internal dataset for which the text is not transcribed but estimated by an ASR system. In this case, a simple late fusion approach boosts the performance even further. This proves that the audio approach is suitable for real-world applications where the transcribed text is not available and has to leverage imperfect ASR results, or even the absence of textual information (to reduce computational cost).  © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a robotic cognitive system which can learn itself to do a specific assignment by accumulating experiences through bottom-up thinking to make decision by itself via top-down thinking according to the experiences. That is, the cognitive system has a self-learning ability which can accumulate its experiences to make itself smarter. In essence, the cognitive system possesses a perception model, a memory model, and a hypothesis model. The perception model converts image information into perception codes. The memory model stores experiences in the past and present to provide to the perception model and the hypothesis model. The hypothesis model, which generates the next decision according to the experiences from the memory model, is the most important part of the proposed cognitive system. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we utilize Chinese calligraphy writing tasks by a virtual robot through simulation to evaluate the abilities of the cognitive system. In order to generate the coordinates of the writing brush, we made the virtual robot practice to learn Chinese calligraphy through bottom-up thinking to construct the writing patterns. The illustrative examples in this paper show that the virtual robot can learn to write Chinese calligraphy by top-down thinking according to its own experiences.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome. © 2022 IEEE.}},

The analysis uses social-economic and academic performance data of undergraduate students from 2012 to 2019. Data mining algorithms such as generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and random forest were applied to the data.

  abstract = {The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don't use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called 'Trashman'. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer's expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game's end. This will evaluate player's performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

The model is based on Bayesian networks and exploits logical gates with uncertainty (often referred to as noisy gates) to reduce the number of parameters of the model, so to simplify their elicitation by experts and allow real-time inference in intelligent tutoring systems. We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills.

  abstract = {This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students' CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students' background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students' understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students' knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  year = {2022}},
  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {The research-to-practice paper presents applications of genetic algorithms using multi-criterion optimization to designate student-teams in an academic setting. Teamwork skills are becoming a more desirable trait in industry today and hence more instructors are using teamwork in their engineering courses. ABET also requires engineering degree programs to have student outcomes that provide them with "an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives."This, however, comes with its challenges because the literature suggests that random or student-selected teams tend to lead to dysfunctional behaviors. Instructor-designated academic teams based on skills, learning personalities, and demographics are known to be more effective in promoting learning and positive interactions. Creating optimal homogeneous or heterogeneous teams based on multiple criteria (e.g., prior knowledge, skills, abilities, psychosocial, demographics) can be a complex and time-consuming task when done manually, especially when large numbers of students are involved.This study presents an expansion of previous work that used single-criterion genetic algorithm optimization of teams in a first-year classroom. The research question answered in this study is, how do teams formed using an algorithm that optimizes multiple criteria with genetic algorithms represent heterogeneity when compared to teams formed manually? Using a Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA), optimization of multiple skills is conducted to attain uniform heterogeneity in the classroom. The algorithm uses discrete integer-type representations as a basic unit of team configuration. Self-reported student competency data on three different computational skills were used. Teams were formed for approximately 1300 students enrolled in a first-year engineering design thinking course at a large Midwestern University. Four-member teams were maximized with a minimum number of teams with 3 students in each section. Average skills of the teams are calculated and the standard deviation in class is minimized for each of three skills parallelly. The algorithm also aims to maintain diversity of teams based on gender and ethnicity.Results presented include visualization of team-configurations and comparison with teams formed manually using the same criteria. The aim of the algorithm is to optimize students into teams that have skills and demographics uniformly distributed across the classroom. Future implications of this study include the potential to use flexible algorithm-based team formations that are built with standard genetic operators so that optimization criteria can be modified by the instructor. Such algorithms can reduce the time needed to manually form teams by a considerable amount and optimize the distribution of skills more uniformly. Steps to further this study will involve investigating whether teams formed using these criteria are more effective. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In the present Research-to-practice Full-paper, the learning, reasoning, and problem-solving processes, in engineering students, have been analyzed from different approaches, one of them is the computational thinking process, where most of the activities must be performed as a computer does and the reasoning is developed with the well-oriented activities realized by them. In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {A Python-based lab activity was developed for a remote Thermodynamics course to add computational thinking to traditional analytical problem solving. Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. Nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. Whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills. © 2022 IEEE.}},

Indeed., the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on using scales or test to measure programming proficiency and neglecting process evaluation in which CT can also be manifested. Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely 'Analysis'., 'Design'., 'Iteration'., and 'Generalization'., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators. Taken together., the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating digital games in measuring CT skills in a comprehensive manner.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

In computer science education a majority of games and approaches exist, that provide engaging environments for students. On the one hand, these can be games related to learning algorithmic thinking but on the other hand, games to learn coding. Besides single-player games, there are also multiplayer games where players compete against each other or collaboratively work on programming tasks. However, many existing multiplayer games offer pre-defined levels where teachers have limited flexibility and individuality for their students. Additionally, many existing game environments use competitive over collaborative approaches. In our project, we extended an existing game by a multiplayer mode where players work together on coding tasks. The game elements support many coding-related concepts but also computational skills such as sequencing, conditionals, loops, and also advanced topics such as concurrency or dependencies using meaningful levels and tasks. However, we conducted an evaluation including 41 participants in three workshops: two in-class activities with secondary school students and an online activity with computer science students. Within these workshops, the students collaboratively worked on coding tasks within the game environment. Thereby, we observed the communication between the students while working on the tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the students' attitudes towards collaborative learning. We found out that the in-game chat is barely used while in-class activities, especially when the tasks require only low coordination between players. We also found out, that students learn from each other and are more motivated when working together. With our approach, we want to provide educators with a flexible game environment where students can collaboratively improve their coding skills while solving engaging tasks. © 2022 Immersive Learning Research Network.}},

  abstract = {In the field of neuroscience, brain activity measurement and analysis are considered crucial areas. Schizophrenia (Sz) is a brain disorder that severely affects the thinking, behavior, and feelings of people worldwide. Thus, an accurate and rapid detection method is needed for proper care and quality treatment of the patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) is proved to be an efficient biomarker in Sz detection as it records brain activities. This article aims to improve the performance of EEG-based Sz detection using a deep-learning approach in remote applications. A hybrid deep-learning model identified as schizophrenia hybrid neural network (SzHNN), which is a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), has been proposed wherein the CNN for local feature extraction and LSTM for classification is utilized. In this article, the proposed model has been compared with several deep-learning and machine-learning-based models. All the models have been evaluated on two different datasets wherein dataset 1 consists of 19 subjects and dataset 2 consists of 16 subjects. The proposed model is also implemented with the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) framework for smart healthcare and remote-based applications. Several experiments have been conducted using various parametric settings on different frequency bands and different sets of electrodes on the scalp. Based on all the experiments, it is evident that the proposed hybrid model (SzHNN) provides the highest classification accuracy of 99.9% compared to other implemented models and existing models of previous papers. The proposed model overcomes the influence of different frequency bands and shows a better accuracy of 96.10% (dataset 1) and 91.00% (dataset 2) with only five electrodes. Subject-wise testing is also done for SzHNN, which proposes an accuracy of 90.11% and 89.60% for datasets 1 and 2, respectively.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

A number of studies using the Brainbit brain-computer were carried out as a part of various activities, including the performance of tasks with the Expert air traffic controller simulator. Findings from computational processing of electroencephalography signals revealed the degree of synchronization of brain hemispheres depending on the complexity of the tasks. We propose to use a ratio of mean values of direct and inverse correlation across short epochs as a synchronization (coordination) factor for the activities of both hemispheres. We were able to identify regularities behind the change of the coordination factor depending on the complexity of the task and the degree of involvement in its performance. Three levels of task complexity (high, medium and low) were identified. The coordination factor will vary depending on the complexity level of a particular task. We were able to determine that a high involvement in the performance of a medium-complexity task is accompanied by a high level of coordination. This lets us determine the attained development level of professional and mental capabilities of an aeronavigation system operator and to develop an individual training path.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

Student dropout rate in computer science is the highest among college majors. Educators are striving to find a way to teach efficiently and effectively the technical and the problem solving skills students need. In this paper we will be studying the effects of syntax exercises on a subject's ability to think computationally and precisely. We tested our process on professionals and students. Half of the professionals were in the computer science field and half of our students did syntax exercises. The other half of professionals and students had no exposure to syntax to compare. Our purpose is to find if teaching students syntax exercises are still relevant and can teach both technical and computational thinking skills.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

We collected data through a survey of 16 teachers at one elementary school in Malang City, Indonesia. They represented a variety of subjects with diverse learning experiences. The survey took place after the respondents received a short training about STEM and Computational Thinking. Quantitative analysis showed that most elementary school teachers positively demonstrated Computational Thinking practices in their schools. Besides, they believed that Computational Thinking could help students think logically, structurally, and creatively, while STEM helped train students to be problem solvers in an analytical, critical, and practical way. In addition, most respondents intended to continue learning and applying STEM and Computational Thinking approaches in their learning design. Added to this, the participants' understanding of STEM and Computational Thinking also improved based on the results of the Wilcoxon test conducted on the pre-test and post-test.

The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT.

This challenges for suitable teaching methodologies and practices, along with oriented learning contents for such devices. On the one hand, teachers and tutors may acquire skills and competences to cope with gadgets and its technologies. On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming. Complementary studies must be addressed aiming at to evaluate the long term effect on children due to the adoption of programming activities in the classroom. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Traditional harmonic analysis annotations can be represented in a computer model of a piece of music by plain text strings. But whenever automated processing like analysis, comparison or retrieval is intended, a formal definition is helpful. This should cover not only the syntactic structure, but also the semantics, i.e. the intended meaning, and thus adheres to the technique of mathematical remodelling of existing cultural phenomena. The resulting models can serve as a basis for automated processing, but also help to clarify the communication and discussion among humans substantially. This article proposes such a definition in four layers, which address different problems of encoding and communication: (a) relation of symbol sequences to staff positions, (b) combining functions, (c) chord roots, and (d) interval structure and voice leading. Only one of them is specific to functional (Riemannian) theory and can possibly be replaced to represent scale degree theory. The proposal is configurable to different interval specification methods and open to localisation. Syntax and semantics are defined by precise mathematical means, borrowed from computer science, and thus are unambiguously documented. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem. © 2022 IEEE.}},

Much recent work in sociology proposes ‘methods mashups’ of ethnography and digital data/computational tools in different and diverse ways.

Returning to anthropology (whence, arguably, ethnography originally came) is, therefore, a useful way to extend our methodological thinking to (re)consider what ethnography is and how it operates, and from there think more clearly about how it may be effectively combined with digital data/computational tools in an emerging ‘Computational Anthropology’. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

  abstract = {The concept of decomposition in computer science and engineering is considered a fundamental component of computational thinking and is prevalent in design of algorithms, software construction, hardware design, and more. We propose a simple and natural formalization of sequential decomposition, in which a task is decomposed into two sequential sub-tasks, with the first sub-task to be executed before the second sub-task is executed. These tasks are specified by means of input/output relations. We define and study decomposition problems, which is to decide whether a given specification can be sequentially decomposed. Our main result is that decomposition itself is a difficult computational problem. More specifically, we study decomposition problems in three settings: where the input task is specified explicitly, by means of Boolean circuits, and by means of automatic relations. We show that in the first setting decomposition is NP-complete, in the second setting it is NEXPTIME-complete, and in the third setting there is evidence to suggest that it is undecidable. Our results indicate that the intuitive idea of decomposition as a systemdesign approach requires further investigation. In particular, we show that adding a human to the loop by asking for a decomposition hint lowers the complexity of decomposition problems considerably. © D. Fried, A. Legay, J. Ouaknine, and M.Y.

  abstract = {Multi-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) requires models to decide the correct answer from a set of answer options when given a passage and a question. Thus, in addition to a powerful Pre-trained Language Model (PrLM) as an encoder, multi-choice MRC especially relies on a matching network design that is supposed to effectively capture the relationships among the triplet of passage, question, and answers. While the newer and more powerful PrLMs have shown their strengths even without the support from a matching network, we propose a new DUal Multi-head Co-Attention (DUMA) model. It is inspired by the human transposition thinking process solving the multi-choice MRC problem by considering each other's focus from the standpoint of passage and question. The proposed DUMA has been shown to be effective and is capable of generally promoting PrLMs. Our proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark multi-choice MRC tasks, DREAM, and RACE. Our results show that in terms of powerful PrLMs, DUMA can further boost the models to obtain higher performance.  © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Scratch is a programming environment, which is widely adopted as the first language to enter the programming world. Since Scratch projects are rich in multimedia resources, it can be time-consuming to judge them by hand, requiring manual execution with the understanding of each project. Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners' projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts' ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

This systematic review evaluated existing studies in improving K-12 students’ computational thinking and STEM attitudes. Research articles published between 2010 and 2019 were collated from major databases according to six criteria, and 17 studies were eligible. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of educational robots in terms of standardized mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD) of test scores as outcome measures. The overall effect size was medium (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23–0.69). Subgroup analysis found that some groups to have better effectiveness. Specifically, the effect of STEM attitudes (SMD = 0.01) was smaller than computational thinking (SMD = 0.48). Educational robots had more significant effect on boys (MD = 0.39) than girls (MD = 0.27). The effect in primary school (SMD = 0.27) was higher than in middle school (SMD = 0.04), and the effect was great on short-term instruction with educational robots (SMD = 0.35). Based on these results, the study makes some recommendations for educators about strengthening the influence of educational robots on STEM attitudes, improving the persistence of their learning effects, and further exploring their application models. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

It is nowadays considered a fundamental skill for students and citizens, that has the potential to affect future generations. At the roots of computational-thinking abilities stands the knowledge of computer programming, i.e. coding. With the goal of fostering computational thinking in young students, we address the challenging and open problem of using methods, tools and techniques to support teaching and learning of computer-programming skills in school curricula of the secondary grade and university courses. This problem is made complex by several factors. In fact, coding requires abstraction capabilities and complex cognitive skills such as procedural and conditional reasoning, planning, and analogical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm called ACME (“Code Animation by Evolved Metaphors”) that stands at the foundation of the Diogene-CT code visualization environment and methodology. We develop consistent visual metaphors for both procedural and object-oriented programming. Based on the metaphors, we introduce a playground architecture to support teaching and learning of the principles of coding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable code visualization tool using consistent metaphors in the field of the Computing Education Research (CER).

  journal = {International Journal of STEM Education}},
  abstract = {Background: Unplugged programming is proved to be an effective means to foster the learner-centered programming learning. In addition to the final tests, learners’ programming knowledge, skills, and capacities are primarily demonstrated throughout the programming process, particularly in the situation when they encounter challenges and problems. However, few studies examine how learners engage in the programming processes and to what extent unplugged programming fosters learning. This research used a quasi-experimental design to investigate two instructional modes in China’s secondary education, namely, the instructor-directed lecturing and the learner-centered unplugged programming. Based on an analytical framework, this research used mixed methods to compare learners’ knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under these two instructional modes. Results: The research results revealed discrepancies between two instructional modes. First, learners in the unplugged programming class achieved significantly higher scores on the programming knowledge assessment, compared to learners in the traditional lecturing class. Second, compared to the traditional lecturing class, learners in the unplugged programming class had higher test scores of the computational thinking skills, particularly on the cooperativity dimension. Next, discrepancies of in-class behaviors showed that learners in the unplugged programming class had frequent behaviors of listening to the instructor’s instructions and discussing with peers, while learners in the instructor-directed class had frequent behaviors of listening to instructor, taking notes, and irrelevant activities. Learners’ self-reported attitudes in the unplugged programming indicated a higher level of confidence than learners in the traditional lecturing class. Overall, this research revealed that the learner-centered unplugged programming had potential to improve learners’ programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes compared to the traditional instructor-directed lecturing of programming. Conclusions: As a feasible and easy-to-use instructional activity in computer science education, unplugged programming is encouraged to be integrated in formal education to increase learners’ programming interests, motivations, and qualities. This quasi-experimental research compared learners’ programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under two instructional modes. The results revealed critical discrepancies between two instructional modes on learners’ knowledge gains, in-class behaviors, and changes of attitudes towards programming.

Research has shown the effectiveness of teaching CT elements (abstraction, generalization, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, debugging) using non-programming, unplugged approaches. These approaches address common barriers teachers face with lack of knowledge, familiarity, or technology tools. Picture books and graphic novels present an unexplored non-programming, unplugged resource for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their CT or CT-integrated lessons. This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books’ target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as “foundational,” “on-target,” or “advanced.” We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived 'computation' as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around 'data', 'model' and 'simulations' critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature.

The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students’ English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students’ foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game.

We present a six-lesson intervention designed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and teachers with a background in computer science and mathematics education that aims to foster pre-university students' AT and generalization skills in calculus lessons. We evaluated the intervention in a 15 students classroom in the Netherlands through the analysis of students' workbooks, files, interviews, and the teacher's logbook. The findings suggest that the intervention was favorably seen by both the teacher and the students, and that their learning and teaching experience was highly satisfactory. The most common challenges for successfully completing the designed material included issues related to getting familiar with GeoGebra, syntax, and effectively using conditional statements. Finally, we report on the learning and teaching experience and discuss strategies to address AT and generalization aspects for teachers who wish to address such CT aspects in mathematics lessons.  © 2021 Owner/Author.}},

The students' difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time.

  abstract = {CT has been the central rallying point for K-12 computing education at least since the early 2010s. Many teachers, school administrators, and policymakers have joined the movement. A consensus has emerged over the conceptual landscape of CT. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) has triggered some major changes in many sectors of computing. Children's lives today are full of ML-driven services - take TikTok's spot-on recommendations, social media's automatic tagging of their friends in photos, and targeted personalized advertisement, just to mention a few. Children cannot learn to think about and design ML technology from learning classical programming. ML is poised to upend the CT consensus. Look at some of the changes ML has already triggered in computing. It has enabled greatly improved speech and image recognition, powerful recommendations on streaming services, autonomous navigation of cars, super-human performance in board and computer games, and even alternative-reality "deepfake"videos. Most advances in topics above are due to hardware evolution to non-traditional, special purpose architectures, new algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or generative adversarial networks (GAN), and new objectives and measures of success. We will show that several key CT concepts, including debugging, problem-solving workflow, correctness, and notional machines, are insufficient for ML and need to be extended. Moreover, ML introduces new concepts including neural networks, curating and training data, and reinforcement learning that are not part of CT at all. All these changes challenge the traditional views related to teaching CT in K-12. ML is not the only emerging technology appearing in the computing landscape. Quantum computing and biological computing are not far behind. We need to start rethinking how CT must evolve to anticipate and meet these challenges.  © 2021 ACM.}},

From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) can be considered a 21st century core skill and, accordingly, it should be taught to students at an early age. Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode. The combination of different assessment methodologies - including CT pre- and posttests, data-driven analytics, direct observation, and questionnaires - provides assessment for each of the framework computational dimensions.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

Programming environments are now widely adopted in classrooms to teach programming concepts. However, these tools are often reliant on visual interaction, making them inaccessible to children with visual impairments. Also, programming environments in general are usually designed to promote individual experiences, wasting the potential benefits of group collaborative activities. We propose the design of a programming environment that leverages asymmetric roles to foster collaborative computational thinking activities for children with visual impairments, in particular mixed-visual-ability classes. The multimodal system comprises the use of tangible blocks and auditory feedback, while children have to collaborate to program a robot.

A recent trend is to introduce basic programming concepts already very early on at primary school level.

In this paper, we describe our experience of a project aiming at supporting local primary schools in introducing children to programming concepts using Ozobot robots. These robots have two distinct advantages: First, they can be programmed with and without computers, thus helping the transition from unplugged programming to programming with a computer. Second, they are small and easy to transport, even when used together with tablet computers. Although we learned in our outreach events that the use of Ozobots is not without challenges, our overall experience is positive and can hopefully support others in setting up first encounters with programming at primary schools.  © 2021 ACM.}},

However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of 'insufficient skills and no training' in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students' computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively.

The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

Through analyzing lesson plans and reflections from 31 preservice special education teachers, the researchers learned that overall emerging promise exists with regard to the limited exposure of preservice special education teachers to CT/CS in mathematics. Specifically, preservice teachers demonstrated the ability to include CT/CS in math lesson plans and showed understanding of how CT/CS might enhance instruction with students with disabilities via reflections on these lessons.

  abstract = {With the global movement to incorporate computer science instruction into elementary education, learners are being introduced to computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) ideas at increasingly younger ages. At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use->Modify->Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores. These results indicate TIPP&SEE's potential in creating more equitable computing instruction. We hope that results from this initial exploration can help encourage further study into the role of cognitive abilities in CS/CT education for young learners. © 2021 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Dialog with a social pedagogical robot or agent is a powerful way for kids to learn [1, 5] but may limit the formation of an agentic relationship with the technology [9]. One main purpose of conversational agents is to allow the user to have a natural interaction that reduces the need to learn artificial conventions [6], but dialog systems fall short with respect to failure recovery, vocabulary diversity, remembering conversational history, and other measures [2, 3]. Further, Hill et. al. [4] found that people adapt their model of communication to match a chatbot's in the same way they do with a child or non-native speaker. Thus, users conversing with a pedagogical agent are implicitly trained to shape their behavior to suit the technology rather than shaping the technology. For young learners, particularly among populations that have been historically excluded from technology fields, this limits agency and reinforces marginalizing power structures [9]. This project combines a conversational agent with ideas of agentic engagement to help middle-school-aged children learn computational thinking. Agentic engagement is defined as students' constructive contribution into the flow of instruction and includes behaviors such as expressing interests, preferences, and opinions. It has been positively correlated to learning performance and motivation [7, 8]. Combined with a culturally responsive curriculum (CRC), agentic engagement may help to foster an agentic relationship with technology. Our system encourages learners to engage agentically by using programming constructs to change the agent's vocabulary, recognizing the intent behind a user utterance (an invocation), and defining the action the agent will take to respond to an invocation. Students use computational thinking concepts such as pattern recognition, abstraction, and decomposition to convert ideas into commands for the dialog system and to understand which of their ideas can't be programmed with the technology as presented. They learn both to personalize the system today and to see the agent as a technosocial construct that they can shape in the future. Programming can be accomplished either using Google's Blockly visual programming tool (https://developers.google.com/blockly) or through conversation with the agent itself. The agent is embodied as a robot character, so agent actions can be verbal, physical, or both. Through social dialog with the agent, learners reflect on how computational thinking is relevant to themselves and their communities as part of a CRC, building on the work of Stewart et. al. [10]. For example, learners may be asked to reflect on the relationship between greeting behaviors and identity. After designing a greeting interaction, learners program the dialog system to achieve the greeting. Then learners may be asked to imagine how they might hypothetically enhance the dialog system to make it even more capable of implementing their preferences. In parallel to the development of the dialog system and curriculum, we will also adapt Reeve's agentic engagement instrument [7] for CRC. Our contributions will include this instrument, insights into the relationship between agentic engagement and an agentic relationship with technology, and insights into how a programmable dialog system impacts agentic engagement and learning computational thinking. © 2021 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Although socializing is a powerful driver of youth engagement online, platforms struggle to leverage social engagement to promote learning. We seek to understand this dynamic using a multi-stage analysis of over 14,000 comments on Scratch, an online platform designed to support learning about programming. First, we inductively develop the concept of “participatory debugging”—a practice in which users learn through the process of collaborative technical troubleshooting. Second, we use a content analysis to establish how common the practice is on Scratch. Third, we conduct a qualitative analysis of user activity over time and identify three factors that serve as social antecedents of participatory debugging: (1) sustained community, (2) identifiable problems, and (3) what we call “topic porousness” to describe conversations that are able to span multiple topics. We integrate these findings in a framework that highlights a productive tension between the desire to promote learning and the interest-driven sub-communities that drive user engagement in many new media environments. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

Due to the heavy influence of the neural networks architecture on its predictive accuracy, neural architecture search has gained much attention in recent years. This research area typically implies a high computational burden and thus, requires high scalability as well as availability to ensure no data loss or waist of computational power. Moreover, the thinking of developing applications has changed from monolithic once to microservices. Hence, we developed a highly scalable and available multi-objective neural architecture search and adopted to the modern thinking of developing application by subdividing an already existing, monolithic neural architecture search - based on a genetic algorithm - into microservices. Furthermore, we adopted the initial population creation by 1, 000 mutations of each individual, extended the approach by inception layers, implemented it as island model to facilitate scalability and achieved on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset 99.75%, 94.35% and 89.90% test accuracy respectively. Besides, our model is strongly focused on high availability empowered by the deployment in our bare-metal Kubernetes cluster. Our results show that the introduced multi-objective neural architecture search can easily handle even the loss of nodes and proceed the algorithm within seconds on another node without any loss of results or the necessity of human interaction. © 2021 IEEE.}},

We analyzed reflections of 80 in-service teachers on TPD through the SPOC (1,091 statements) and conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 of them one year after completing the course and teaching ECR in the classroom (328 statements). The most prominent strategies immediately after the TPD were constructing learning experiences, tinkering & debugging, and interdisciplinary learning, while one year later, experiential learning and collaborative learning were more common. Regarding the degree of teacher centrality, a year after teaching ECR curriculum the teachers had a significantly higher percentage of statements reflecting their role as a guide-on-the-side and as a partner of students in the learning process. Regarding the contribution of the SPOC for TPD, teacher statements revealed significantly more benefits than challenges in both points of time. Interestingly, the same categories emerged bottom-up as benefits and challenges: a variety of control dimensions, independent learning, learning and knowledge management and collaboration.

To review the current elementary CT assessments for potential gaps, and seek additional methodologies to expand our understanding of CT, an integrative literature review of 75 research papers was performed in two phases. In Phase One, we conducted a critical analysis of existing elementary CT assessment studies. Key results include: 1) Artifact analysis, CT assessment items, and interviews are the most common methods utilized to assess CT in elementary grades; 2) Existing CT assessments primarily focus on students' computational artifacts and performance on CT tests; however, strategies to study students' thought processes during CT problem-solving are limited and under-utilized. Guided by the results of phase one, along with the theoretical perspective that connected CT to visual processing ability, in phase two we performed a survey of literature in the area of understanding cognitive processes through eye-tracking (i.e., visual attention) and think-aloud methodologies (i.e., verbalization). We focused on eye-tracking and think-aloud methodologies as these have been used to understand students' cognitive processes during problem-solving in other areas.

However, most prior literature defines computational thinking as thinking outcomes rather than thinking processes. Based on Selby and Woodland’s framework, this study developed and validated the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) to assess all students’ thought processes of computational thinking for both general and specific problem-solving contexts in five dimensions: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, evaluation and generalization. A survey including 25 candidate items for CTS as well as demographic variables was administered to 388 junior high school students in Taiwan. An explorative factor analysis using the principal axis method with the oblimin rotation was used to validate the scale. Finally, 19 items were extracted successfully under the designed five dimensions, with a total explained variance of 64.03% and an overall reliability of 0.91. Results of the demographic comparisons showed that boys had a greater disposition than girls in decomposition thinking when solving problems using computer programming. In addition, programming learning experience, especially self-directed learning and after-school learning, had significant positive effects on all dimensions of CTS. Several future studies are suggested using this tool. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

  abstract = {The demand for computational thinking (CT) problem solving abilities surge as every aspect of life becomes more dependent on complex digital technologies. Just as in math and language, a strong CT foundation needs to be established in early education in order for students to develop an instinctive CT perspective of the world. The urgent demand for CT instruction in elementary school quickly draws attention to the shortage of elementary school-level teachers qualified and interested in CT. Additionally, with a commitment to equity in the United States education system and knowledge of the high percentage of English language learning (ELL) students in schools, the obligation to create curricula that will provide access to CT knowledge, skills, and practices for elementary-level ELL students is loudly apparent. In response to these two needs, our team has adapted existing Scratch-based CT curriculum to support classroom teachers with minimal CT experience and to be more accessible to English language learners. The purpose of this paper is to share the framework that guided the curriculum adaptations, to describe the specific changes that were made, and to discuss discoveries made during the process. This journey may be helpful to anyone who is tasked with modifying a curriculum to meet the needs of novice content teachers and ELL students.  © 2021 Owner/Author.}},

Fifty-two elementary school students (52) participated in the experimental study. Following an experimental design, data were collected and analyzed from a combination of knowledge test scores, storytelling, motivation, and anxiety surveys. The experimental results indicate that the CT strategy improves students’ language learning and raises their motivation in the two dimensions of extrinsic and intrinsic goal orientation. These results imply the positive effect of CT strategy on strengthening problem-solving skills of students participating in digital storytelling and increases their motivation and performance in English language learning. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2, 290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context. © 2021 IEEE.}},

Two teacher educators recently implemented a series of readings and activities in their methods courses designed to help preservice teachers sophisticate their conceptions of texts beyond autonomous, neutral collections of information by considering digital age ideas such as software theory, textual ideology, and the algorithmic bias of the Internet. The authors review recent scholarship surrounding the integration of computational thinking and the humanities before illustrating a theoretical framework that combines software-driven interpretation and critical media literacy. Descriptions and applications of course texts and exercises precede a discussion on typological methodology. Through the analysis of semester-long writing reflections and course interactions, a typology of preservice teachers is then presented, illustrating three archetypes: Strategists, Hawkeyes, and Improvers. These archetypes are taken up to analyze the ways in which a range of teacher candidates considered ontological notions of digital texts to analyze instructional techniques, to sharpen their critical lenses, or to gain greater understanding of ELA as a discipline (or some combination of all three). This work demonstrates that as teacher educators and teacher candidates increasingly consider software-powered literacies, interrogations of who we are, who we are becoming, and what it all means requires attention to, and explicit practice with, the dark side of digital texts. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

  abstract = {Debugging code is a central skill in learning to program. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if 'the internet' stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience. © 2021 IEEE.}},

While there was no significant difference between the students’ conceptual knowledge and algorithmic thinking skills, the evaluation skills of male students differed significantly compared to females. Programming experience has a significant effect on conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation. The algorithmic thinking skills of the students who have low, middle, and high-level programming experience differed significantly. In terms of the development of conceptual knowledge and evaluation skills, it was observed that students should have at least one year of programming experience, but this experience will not make a significant difference if it is four years or more.

At an educational level, applying the concepts and logic of programming is a complex task for the student. The investigation of this problem was carried out with the intention of knowing if there are tools that could help the student understand programming by using augmented reality technology. For this purpose, a systematic mapping study was carried out to identify, filter and classify the information through a query applied in different ways of research. As a result, 34 articles were selected and classified. The main results show that: a) programming learning is not limited in terms of the student's age; b) Augmented reality has potential advantages in programming learning; c) Due to the extensive content of the programming, applications focused on specific topics were found according to the level of studies; d) The software used in the development of AR applications, mostly uses Unity with Vuforia; and, e) Augmented reality contributes to different learning techniques and styles that improve the way information is perceived and visualized.

Moreover, there is a lack of integration of adaptivity into educational computer games for computational thinking, which is crucial to addressing individual needs in developing computational thinking skills. In this study, we present an adaptive educational computer game, called AutoThinking, for developing students’ computational thinking skills in addition to their conceptual knowledge. To evaluate the effects of the game, we conducted an experimental study with 79 elementary school students in Estonia, where the experimental group learned with AutoThinking, while the control group used a traditional technology-enhanced learning approach. Our findings show that learning with the adaptive educational computer game significantly improved students’ computational thinking related to both conceptual knowledge and skills. Moreover, students using the adaptive educational computer game showed a significantly higher level of interest, satisfaction, flow state, and technology acceptance in learning computational thinking.

To do this we used the Crumble controller, a platform that is programmed using block programming language. This platform also allows making electrical connections in an amazingly simple way. From the mechanical point of view, we use materials that can be easily machined, both by children and by inexperienced people.

While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops. © 2021 IEEE.}},

The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument.

This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: Frame shifting focused teachers' attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject's particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers. © 2021 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Block-based programming languages effectively address syntactic difficulties allowing users to more easily create code. Syntactic code support is no doubt a crucial step in enabling the next generation of programmers. However, in what other ways do these tools support the computational thinking (CT) process? For example, how is CT supported in both the semantic and pragmatic levels? Most users do not just want to write code?they want to create interesting artifacts such as video games, simulations, stories and robots. No doubt that users must code to build these artifacts, but just as important, though often overlooked, is that users must also have an understanding of tool affordances to effectively build these artifacts. The position presented in this paper is that the comprehension of affordances is essential to each stage of the computational thinking process. To that end, we introduce the Hourglass Challenge as a way for students to experience affordances through a programming challenge based on mis-aligned tools and problems. The results from a study, with 54 preservice elementary school teachers, indicate that the affordances of tools can have profound consequences on computational thinking. For instance, the affordances various tools provide can be the difference between creating a simulation versus an animation. But just as hammers are not intrinsically better tools than screwdrivers, the contribution of this position paper is not to compare tools, but to promote efforts that enable learners to develop a better understanding of computational thinking tool affordances as essential mediators between problems and tools. © 2021 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is taught in many universities and is a trending elective option among engineering students. Although analyzing computational fluid dynamics simulations is exciting enough, the theory is equation intensive, sometimes very abstract and also difficult to visualize for the novice. A creative thinking based approach termed synectics, which involves analogies, was therefore applied in classroom teaching to increase student comfort with the equations. For this purpose six analogies encompassing basic computational fluid dynamics concepts were developed along with pictorial representations, and are presented in this work. These analogies were integrated into classroom teaching via synectics procedures. Student feedback was positive and reflected higher engagement with the course compared to when the metaphoric activity was not implemented. This work attempts to demonstrate the feasibility and value of applying creative techniques, even when teaching a highly structured and equation oriented course such as computational fluid dynamics. © The Author(s) 2019.}},

To support the kinds of computer science curriculum and instruction that makes this possible, there is an urgent need to develop and validate computational thinking (CT) assessments for elementary-aged students. We developed the Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students (ACES) to measure the CT concepts of loops and sequences for students in grades 3-5. The ACES includes block-based coding questions as well as non-programming, Bebras-style questions. We conducted cognitive interviews to understand student perspectives while taking the ACES. We piloted the assessment with 57 4th grade students who had completed a CT curriculum. Preliminary analyses indicate acceptable reliability and appropriate difficulty and discrimination among assessment items.

Data included interviews with teachers, professional development providers, and school administrators as well as surveys from teachers and classroom observations in each participating school. Findings revealed three distinct approaches to integration: (a) single teacher leader-driven model, (b) scaffolded professional development model, and (c) intensive coaching model. These approaches reflect the visions set by administrators and teachers, methods used by professional development providers, and cultures of each school. Across the case studies, common pedagogical approaches included strategic use of both unplugged and plugged activities with a range of computational tools, a focus on collaborative project-based learning, and the use of CT-specific academic language to anchor new CT learning within the academic disciplines.

In this study, we measured Korean students' ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools. © 2021 ACM.}},

This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts.

In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming.

However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method.

The mentoring activity is thus viewed within a typical chemistry education paradigm. Some challenges basically continue those encountered at undergraduate level and others are specific to the postgraduate one, thus requiring new approaches. The information presented in the article is mostly based on the author’s long experience at the University of Venda (South Africa). The approach utilised in the study is a suitable adaptation of action research. The analysis aims at being comprehensive, considering the major features influencing students’ performance, and the strategies that can be adopted to counteract negative impacts and to foster the development of scientific modes of thinking and of research independence. It outlines how known major difficulties, such as diffuse poor language mastery (aggravated by second language instruction), complicate both the undergraduate-postgraduate transition—by affecting the speed and extent to which students learn new approaches—and the further stages, including thesis writing. Writing-related difficulties are given particular attention because they have great impact even for students who have acquired good abilities with the design and practical components of research projects, and because the acquisition of adequate skills in scientific writing is an inherent objective of postgraduate training. Most of the reported observations refer to postgraduate studies in computational chemistry; this enables a broad perspective, by including the common challenges of obtaining, organising and analysing data, as well as the challenges related to learning a new area of chemistry, not encountered in undergraduate studies, and those related to specific demands such as adequate mathematics knowledge, visualization abilities and the ability to abstract thinking. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.}},

The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions. © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is an essential skill in digital society. With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6-8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group. Item analysis was conducted for each item, based on which decisions about the refinement of the test were made. Directions for future research are discussed.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme 'Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development'. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession.

The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%.

In the 2019-2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique 'synchronized' online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years.

  abstract = {While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms. © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This Research-to-Practice Full Paper examines the Bebras Challenge tasks, a Computational Thinking (CT) contest that does not require programming knowledge. Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond 'a set of order instructions', even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {A key strategy for bringing computer science (CS) education to all students is the integration of computational thinking (CT) into core curriculum in elementary school. But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All. © 2021 IEEE.}},

CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading.

The proposed network, termed as "KR-LISTA", provides a parameter-efficient unrolling which enables training with limited data. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of KR-LISTA at test time for different values of SNR, and support sizes which were not provided to the network during training.

  abstract = {The ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar plays an important role in surveillance, precision tracking, and classification of ground moving targets. The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed. To achieve the same level of accuracy, the TD-PF requires more than 40,000 particles with about 508 times more computational cost relative to the EKF. Contrary to conventional thinking, our results show that for cases analyzed the EKF produces the best accuracy with stable performance and lowest computational cost. © 2021 IEEE.}},

The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field.

The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field.

  abstract = {This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the teaching of coding and computational thinking has become increasingly important in the school environment. If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school. © SoftCOM 2021.

The research device focuses on integrating thinking skills into 3D games with real-time user interaction. From mixed reality (MR) the application of technology is evaluated in its use for learning effectiveness. The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game. This game can be an alternative learning medium for the educator in primary school (Grade 4-6). The assessment of target users 10-15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers. Thus, this project contributes to the computing education community by using available cutting-edge technology as an optional teaching tool in CT that suits learners in education at the primary level and looks toward future development for higher education.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

In this sense, ER has been used to improve educational practices. There are several initiatives that seek to stimulate Computational Thinking (CT) to stand out. Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours. Finally, LEGO® is the most used technology in class.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call 'mining cultural capital'. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers. © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (CS), there is a growing push for inclusion of CS concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (CT), in required subjects like science. Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms. © 2021 IEEE.}},

And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology.

During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing.

The case study follows a thick description approach to evaluating the engagement potential of the instructional design, as well as the didactic choices made during implementation. We conclude that Bebras cards and Dash robots provide considerable support for a playful engagement with computational concepts and engaging children with different scientific backgrounds in Computational Thinking. In particular, flexibility in how they are used and easy adaptation of challenge level make them useful in contexts with broad participation. Additionally we find that using robots to provide a link between the theoretical presentation of CT in the Bebras card and a physical representation and programming challenge is engaging and helps participants to focus on algorithmic concepts.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else's story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

School outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. In this paper we present a set of technologies developed to reproduce the school trip experience, allowing students to stay at home or in school and requiring only a Web browser and Internet access, while integrating communication tools that allow participants to actively be engaged in interactive lessons and educational experiences. In 2020 the tool has been used during the 'CodyTrip' event, a two-day visit to the town of Urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. Results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics. Findings also suggest that this solution may be adopted not only as a contingent substitute for traveling during the pandemic, but as an effective tool to widen the scope and appeal of cultural tourism.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is being recognized as a critical component of student success in the digital era. Many contend that integrating CT into core curricula is the surest method for providing all students with access to CT. However, the CT community lacks an agreed-upon conceptualization of CT that would facilitate this integration, and little effort has been made to critically analyze and synthesize research on CT/content integration (CTCI). Conflicting CT conceptualizations and little understanding of evidence-based strategies for CTCI could result in significant barriers to increasing students’ access to CT. To address these concerns, we analyzed 80 studies on CT education, focusing on both the CT conceptualizations guiding current CT education research and evidence-based strategies for CTCI. Our review highlights the code-centric nature of CT education and reveals significant gaps in our understanding of CTCI and CT professional development for teachers. Based on these findings, we propose an approach to operationalizing CT that promotes students’ participation in CT, present promising methods for infusing content with CT, and discuss future directions for CT education research. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {Learning to program at an early age has been shown to be a vehicle for the development of Computational Thinking. Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards. © 2013 IEEE.}},

Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have turned-off potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, all politics are local, and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

The proposed system ensures permanent protection of the biometric data as templates are stored and compared in the encrypted domain. For the verification, we present two options which can be achieved as real-time transactions: A well-established classical two-party computation scheme or a recent post-quantum upgrade of that scheme. Both methods maintain full biometric performance.

  abstract = {The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program.

Cybersecurity is of similar importance; however, it can be difficult for young learners to grasp the required concepts and use them to construct meaningful algorithms. We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The recent shift in compulsory education from ICT-focused computing curricula to informatics, digital literacy and computer science, has resulted in children being taught computing using block-based programming tools such as Scratch, with teaching that is often limited by school resources and teacher expertise. Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with ‘code smells’ such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game’s efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

There is normally a virtual character or a physical robot that has to collect items or reach a goal within a map. Visually, these activities tend to be exciting enough to maintain children engaged: there is constant feedback about the actions being performed, and the virtual environments tend to be stimulating and aesthetically pleasant. Conversely, in adaptations for visually impaired children, these environments tend to become poorer, damaging the story at the cost of the programming actions and its dull mechanics (e.g., place a arrow block to move the character forward). In this paper, we present TACTOPI, a playful environment designed from the ground up to be rich in both its story (a nautical game) and its mechanics (e.g., a physical robot-boat controlled with a 3D printed wheel), tailored to promote computational thinking at different levels (4 to 8 years old).

Learning how to program not only enables learners to develop computing applications, but it can also enhance learners’ computational thinking (CT) practice.

Along with growing academic interests towards CT in recent studies, researchers have emphasized the role of teaching programming in facilitating learners’ problem-solving skills. Emerging OERs have expanded learners’ opportunities to engage in hands-on programming exercises; yet a challenge still remains as to how learners’ programming exercises can be tailored to accommodate individual differences in terms of learners’ digital literacy skills. There is still a lack of in-depth discussions on how to support learners’ personalized learning experiences during programming exercises associated with CT.

Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like. © 2020 IEEE.}},

In Italy, even if the introduction of CT and programming in schools is on the pipeline of policy makers, they have not yet been included in the curriculum guidelines. Consequently, there is a strong case for analyzing how programming can be integrated at early stages into the Italian compulsory education. Starting from the constructivist tradition, a study spanning over several school years has been organized aiming at defining and testing a programming learning path for primary schools. The learning path takes into account children's interests, stimulating their passions and creativity. Students are engaged on projects that are meaningful for them, while teachers take advantage of the situations that spontaneously arise to guide students' attention on specific computational concepts. The learning path is being iteratively refined through a field experiment involving a primary school over a four year period. The study aims to the following questions: • Under which conditions can age-appropriate programming activities, allowing for individual differences in learning styles and approaches, work in primary school? • Which indications can the work performed provide to the sustainability of the programming activities when the researchers' support will come to an end? • Which elements of the study can provide suggestions for a wider introduction of programming in primary schools?

  journal = {International Journal of STEM Education}},
  abstract = {Background: Educational robotics (ER) is increasingly used in classrooms to implement activities aimed at fostering the development of students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Though previous works have proposed different models and frameworks to describe the underlying concepts of CT, very few have discussed how ER activities should be implemented in classrooms to effectively foster CT skill development. Particularly, there is a lack of operational frameworks, supporting teachers in the design, implementation, and assessment of ER activities aimed at CT skill development. The current study therefore presents a model that allows teachers to identify relevant CT concepts for different phases of ER activities and aims at helping them to appropriately plan instructional interventions. As an experimental validation, the proposed model was used to design and analyze an ER activity aimed at overcoming a problem that is often observed in classrooms: the trial-and-error loop, i.e., an over-investment in programming with respect to other tasks related to problem-solving. Results: Two groups of primary school students participated in an ER activity using the educational robot Thymio. While one group completed the task without any imposed constraints, the other was subjected to an instructional intervention developed based on the proposed model. The results suggest that (i) a non-instructional approach for educational robotics activities (i.e., unlimited access to the programming interface) promotes a trial-and-error behavior; (ii) a scheduled blocking of the programming interface fosters cognitive processes related to problem understanding, idea generation, and solution formulation; (iii) progressively adjusting the blocking of the programming interface can help students in building a well-settled strategy to approach educational robotics problems and may represent an effective way to provide scaffolding. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide initial evidence on the need for specific instructional interventions on ER activities, illustrating how teachers could use the proposed model to design ER activities aimed at CT skill development. However, future work should investigate whether teachers can effectively take advantage of the model for their teaching activities. Moreover, other intervention hypotheses have to be explored and tested in order to demonstrate a broader validity of the model. © 2020, The Author(s).}},

Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency. We assert that this approach, along with the inclusion of a timely epidemiology case study, enabled learners to more deeply internalize the role that computational thinking can play in their own lives and in society as a whole.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

These four phenomena are closely related to the light-based properties of presence, knowledge, power, and harmony, central to a multilayered light-based model of reality that also offers alternative foundation for thinking about quanta and quantum computation. In this model, it is not a random process from infinite superposed possibilities that exist at the quantum-level as supposed by the Copenhagen Interpretation, and as assumed as the foundation of the infinite processing capability of quantum objects by contemporary pioneers of quantum computing. Rather, the infinite processing capability is due to a more ordered display of superposition, entanglement, tunneling and annealing: superposition, as an ordered concord of light's property of presence stacked in logical arrangement by layer of light; entanglement, as a display of light's property of knowledge that occurs at a speed faster than the known speed of light; tunneling, as a display of light's property of power that allows toggling between different 'realities' in layers of light; and annealing, expressing light's property of harmony, to find an ideal minimum state among a number of realities. These four quantum phenomena derivative from an implicit and natural unity within light, engineered to maintain that unity externally, will confer quantum computation with the possibility of extraordinary processing power. © 2020 IEEE.}},

To examine the effect of its impact on teachers' self-efficacy in CT, a quasi-experiment method of a single group pretest-posttest was conducted, and quantitative and qualitative data were collected from scales, artifacts, and interviews. The results revealed that the online PD course significantly improved teaching self-efficacy in CT of these teachers.

  abstract = {This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Technology can be both a bane and a boon to education. Social media apps and digital games offer rich and highly stimulating forms of engagement outside of the classroom. This level of stimulus has created challenges for traditional educational paradigms and approaches. A promising response is for educators to embrace technology through interactive apps and gamification. This workshop provides hands-on engagement with a collection of freely-available interactive web apps that focus on the development of visual, spatial, and computational thinking. The workshop concludes with participants playing a third-person Unity game in which the (interactive) standalone web apps presented in the workshop have been embedded. The game, inspired by Han Solo's Kessel run, involves a trek across a sequence of platforms located in a galaxy far far away. Teleportation from one platform to the next is enabled by correctly completing the activity contained in the embedded (and interactive) web apps and then having the player walk through a portal. The player game score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of their engagement with the exercises present. © 2020 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {This research full paper describes our experience in teaching parallel programming for students without previous knowledge of basic concepts of computing, comparing their levels of learning. The use of parallel software grew considerably in recent years due to the increasing availability of multi and many-core devices. The evolution of hardware and software resources collaborated for a remarkable computational processing power offered by parallel programs. However, parallel programming is taught usually in more advanced years of the undergraduate computer courses, due to its supposed prerequisites as sequential programming, operating systems, computer architectures and others. Postponing parallel programming teaching hinder students to apply parallelism other subjects, reducing the probability of these future professionals think on parallel solutions naturally. We executed 05 experiments teaching parallel programming subjects for 252 students. We analyzed whether students without prerequisites could learn parallel programming in the same level verified with students with prior computing knowledge. We used three different teaching methodologies: traditional, Problem Based Learning (PBL), and Team-Based Learning (TBL). The teaching and learning evaluation took into account such metrics: parallelism thinking of students, use of programming-model, correct output of the program, source-code readability and satisfaction of the students. The paper shows that it is possible to teach parallel programming to students without previous knowledge of computing, obtaining high scores and interest in such learning. Our results contribute positively to disseminate parallel programming, which is vital to extract performance from nowadays computers. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Persistence has proven to be a great challenge in online learning environments. Gaming and interactivity have been suggested as essential features in reducing dropout and increasing persistence in online learning. Yet in interactive game-based learning environments, persistence in moving forward in the game may come at the expense of investing in each of the game’s levels. That is, the motivation to complete the game may have a deleterious effect on learning at specific levels and hence on learning from the game in general. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on microlevel persistence (i.e., persistence during each component of the learning process). We study microlevel persistence in the context of acquiring computational thinking—the thought process of solving problems through abstraction—which is a key component of the new literacies needed for tomorrow’s citizens. In this study, we analyze data collected from an online, game-based learning environment (CodeMonkey™). The data document the activity of first to sixth graders (N = 2,040). Overall, we find that persistence is positively associated with difficulty and that the most determined learners were highly persistent across topics in achieving the best solution. © The Author(s) 2019.}},

Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD.

Computer Science as a subject at post-primary will enable students solve real-world problems through the design and creation of computational artefacts developed using a collaborative human-centred approach. Developing such artefacts requires particular skills, such as creativity and problem-solving and it will be necessary for Computer Science pre-service teachers to use innovative problem-solving approaches when fostering these skills.

Following scientific studies that were aimed at understanding and predicting the evolution of these systems, and fueled by technological advances, research has started to investigate CAS engineering: the methods, tools, and techniques for building CASs. This naturally leads to a vision where collectives of humans and computational elements, situated both in the digital and physical worlds, collaborate to give rise to 'intelligent' collective behavior supporting novel kinds of applications and services. Humans can be involved in two ways: both as users and as components of the CAS, in the sense that human behaviors and limitations are often integral to the system description. This has significant social implications that need to be considered by CAS researchers: in this paper, we share a discussion that took place between some experts thinking about CAS engineering, focusing on the social implication of CASs and related open research challenges.

  abstract = {Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results. © 2020 IEEE.}},

A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures I at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors.

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {This work in progress study aims at developing a system to designate teams to relatively large groups of students in a classroom setting. It is motivated by recent changes in the ABET Criterion 3 accreditation guideline that requires students to demonstrate an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. Outside of accreditation guidelines, team-based learning is becoming the prescribed pedagogical tool to enhance student collaboration and prepare them for professional work environments upon graduation. One important factor in effective team-based learning is to ensure teams are balanced in their abilities and characteristics across team members. Demographical memberships of students can also play an important role in team dynamics and impact the overall success in content learning. Instructors usually assign teams to students by manually looking into their abilities from previous grades and other performance factors. This can then become tedious when aiming to maintain uniform heterogeneity in classrooms of students coming from diverse backgrounds of knowledge, skills, ethnicity, and gender.While some studies have presented the use of computer-aided tools, visualization categorization, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, this work proposes the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to form teams optimized for heterogeneity. The Genetic Algorithm presented uses a discrete integer-based chromosome representation and groups alleles to represent each team. Standard GA operators enable the algorithm to be adapted to any optimizing criteria deemed fit by the instructor. The algorithm presented in this work uses self-reported competency data on 3 different computational skills for 1300 students enrolled in a firstyear engineering design thinking course divided into over 20course sections of strength 40-60 each. Net team scores for each computational tool are calculated and the variation across each skill minimized by the fitness function for individual sections. Constraints based on gender and ethnicity are applied to minimize demographical imbalance between teams. The algorithm is tested for all sections in the Fall 2019 cohort to give consistent team configuration. Discussions on the stability and validity of configurations generated are discussed. Future work include methods that use a fuzzy logic decision-making tool for multiple criteria optimization. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In the 21st Century, technology has become a part of almost everyone's lives in the world and will keep on evolving. Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable. This application has achieved the usability and user experience goals because all the scores from the measurements using those four metrics are above the average.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This full research-track paper demonstrates growth in computational thinking in a cohort of engineering students completing their first course in engineering at a large Southwestern university in the United States. Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This full research paper focuses on the design of a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the sharing of teaching practices (TPs) amongst computer science instructors. Many years of valuable TPs can be lost due to academic retirement when no competent knowledge management system is available for recording these TPs. Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features. The findings of this study hold considerable promise in relation to developing engaging and effective knowledge sharing systems for use by academic instructors. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Research and full paper. Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments. © 2020 IEEE.}},

Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation.

Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

This metaphor facilitates novel ways of thinking about organisms that defy the assumptions of the old machine metaphor. But like all metaphors, the cognitive metaphor discloses important similarities at the expense of eclipsing significant dissimilarities. I argue that although cognitivism carries with it the crucial insight that living organisms are agents rather than mere automata, this metaphor distorts the nature of biological agency by over-intellectualizing, which risks eliminating the distinction between life and mind. I trace the Cartesian root of these metaphors and argue that it generates a dilemma between mechanism and intellectualism. To capture the middle path that most organisms occupy between these two extremes, I propose an ecological account of natural agency. © 2020 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.}},

  abstract = {With the rise of Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the elementary level, it is imperative for elementary computing instruction to support a variety of learners. TIPP&SEE is a meta-cognitive learning strategy that scaffolds student learning when learning from example code. Results from a previous study show statistically-significant performance differences favoring students using the TIPP&SEE strategy on a written assessment. In this work, our goal is gain insight as to it why such dramatic learning differences may have occurred. We analyze the students' computational artifacts and TIPP&SEE worksheets. Artifact analysis reveals that students in the TIPP&SEE group are more thorough in their work, completing more elements of the required tasks. In addition, they build open-ended projects with longer scripts that utilize more learned blocks. Worksheet analysis shows that students were highly accurate on some types of questions but largely skipped others. Despite these positive behaviors, there was little statistical correlation between student worksheet correctness, project completion, and written assessment performance. Therefore, while students in the TIPP&SEE group performed actions we believe lead to more success, no individual actions directly explain the results. Like other meta-cognitive strategies, the value of TIPP&SEE may lie in cognitive processes not directly observable, and may vary based upon individual student differences. © 2020 ACM.}},

  abstract = {One of the shortcomings of many modern serious games and medical simulations lies in their inability to model even some modicum of unpredictability of real life situations. Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

Being aware of that, a design company created the Empathy Map (EM), which is usually employed in the initial phase of the Design Thinking process to understand user's concerns, feelings and aspirations [3]. Teaching practices known as student-centered, inherited from the constructivist school, are not new [4]. Several educators have applied these approaches inside the Computer Science (CS) classroom [5]. A key to success in CS education is the construction of the computational thinking [5]. Learning to program is not an easy task and the process is surrounded by several emotional reactions such as frustration, anxiety, happiness and others [6]. In this sense, EMs can be useful to capture student's feelings, guiding educators strategies during CS classes. Here, I describe the experience of using the EM inside the Computer Science classroom at the University Center Barão de Mauá. The process of building EMs involves the description of the persona, who, in this case, are the students of a given year in the CS course. In the center of EM, the picture of a student is drawn and the surrounding region is divided into 4 areas [3, 7]: 1) THINK and FEEL - What are the students thinking/feeling? 2) HEAR and SEE - What are the students hearing/seeing? 3) SAY and DO - What are the students saying/doing? 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES and GAINS - What are the challenges the students are facing? Is there anything painful to do? How do they measure success? The EM was performed in two different stages of the CS course: in the first and third years. The students were asked to build the EM, representing their feelings and aspirations about CS. The EM of the first year showed: 1) THINK and FEEL - "thinking about the future", "feeling fear", "curiosity", "insecurity", "confusion". 2) HEAR and SEE - "hearing positive statements from family and friends", "seeing themselves in a trainee program", "working or doing a master's degree", "developing themselves". They also reported to hear that CS is very difficult. 3) SAY and DO - They say learning is difficult, They do study and work; 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES - they report feeling insecure about finishing the course and find a position. The main challenge is to conciliate both working and studies. The students of the third year reported: 1) THINK and FEEL - "thinking about the future", "feeling anxiety", "anger", "tiredness", "worry"; 2) HEAR and SEE - "they hear that CS is a promising career", "see opportunities and/or lack of them". They reported hear questions about what they will do in the future; 3) SAY and DO - "procrastinating and working"; 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES - The pain reported refers to the anxiety of completing the course and the excessive procrastination. The main challenge reported was to set medium/short term goals as study to complete tasks in the CS course. As a conclusion, we highlight that the first year students were more motivated about their future, whereas the third year are tired and anxious about finishing the course. The EM construction was able to show student's feelings and pains about the course, allowing the educator to capture the student's perspectives. Based on that, it may be possible to conduct a more appropriate learning plan to manage how emotional aspects can influence the learning process. As a future work, EM will be used along with specific subjects in a qualitative study, considering subjects with highest failure rates in CS curriculum. © 2020 Owner/Author.}},

Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of Estonian primary school children. The findings showed that AutoThinking is making children feel challenged, happy, and confident, while activating their thinking process during the gameplay.

However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for schoolchildren, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory - IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities. © 2020 IEEE.}},

The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games. Aim: This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results: Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion: The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities.

How can we program an artefact so that the code can be created, modified and reflected upon based on directly observable and non-technical abstractions? In this paper we present Storycoding, a computational-thinking based method for programming that focuses on bridging the representational abstractions.

The model takes advantage of an automatic assessment system initially designed for STEM disciplines, then adopted for teaching languages and other disciplines too. The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects. We chose MDD because it is a topic of Computer Science education connected with Computational Thinking, software design, and formal methods, which are three of the core areas in need of enhanced support. © 2020 IEEE.}},

In this paper, in order to provide the resources which the users require, we propose a Scratch Recommendation Framework Adaptive to User Interest Drifts (SRFA-UID). First, a user interest drifts model is designed, which adopts the time decay factor and the weights of operation behaviors to track users' dynamic interest. Then, on the basis of users' current and historical interest, we calculate their combined user similarity. Next, we present a novel two-hop-algorithm to update users' friend community. Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users. For an item, the function can calculate its F value to determine if we can recommend it to the users. Experimental results show that SRFA-UID performs better than other state-of-the-art methods in the Scratch dataset. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  journal = {International Journal of Architectural Computing}},
  abstract = {Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

Much CT focus on abstraction naturally emphasizes (1) extraction of a set of features from an object or process, and (2) finding commonality between objects and processes. But Rosen [38] encourages us to think about abstraction as also including the production of new concepts or actions. Integrating CT into science offers the possibility of enhancing this aspect of abstraction. Changing the representational affordances available to the students allows them to take their CT thinking beyond learning-to-abstract towards learning-throughabstraction.

Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This experience report describes an approach for helping elementary schools integrate computational thinking and coding by leveraging existing resources and infrastructure that do not rely on 1-1 computing. A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon unplugged knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by preand post- surveys. We conclude with lessons learned about ways to improve the unit and future classroom implementations. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.}},

This computational thinking exam is intended to be used in computing education research as a common measure of computational thinking so that the research community will be able to make more meaningful comparisons across samples and studies. The Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test (CTCAST) was administered to students in several courses, evaluated and revised, and then administered to another group of students. Part of the revision included changing half of the items to a multiple-select format. The test scores using the three scoring methods were compared to each other and to scores on a different test of core computer science knowledge. Results indicate the CTCAST and the test of core computer science knowledge measure similar, but not identical, aspects of students' knowledge and skills, and that itemlevel statistics vary according to the scoring method that is used.

  abstract = {Central to the theory of learning are inquiry-based approaches to education. Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computer science for all initiatives have broadened the participation of students enrolled in elective computer science (CS) courses and introduced compulsory CS instruction in many areas of the United States. However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The common approach for introducing middle school and high school students to computational thinking and engineering is through programming or robotics activities that were designed without much social context. Therefore, one of the challenges such outreach programs pose is further stereotyping of students who are interested in computer science, by presenting them as people who ought to be hyper-intelligent and very much focused on computers with no social skills. Realizing the above, and wanting to attract a diverse audience to study computer science, we developed a one-day workshop which showcases the interdisciplinary nature of computer science and the various ways computing can help students discover and solve societal problems. We chose multiculturalism, cyber security and air pollution as the context of our computational thinking activities. This paper describes our experiences in developing and teaching the workshops that runs three to five times a year, hosted either in our institute or at local schools. Regardless of students' previous STEM experiences and socioeconomic statuses, both students and teachers reported that the knowledge gained enabled them to either create a computer program or a robot and also led to a better understanding of how computers can be used in daily life. In other words, the workshop successfully opened the minds and perspectives of the middle school and high school students on computer science. Additionally, over time, we also observed an increased number of students and schools participating in such workshops. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design.

We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch.

  abstract = {A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures. © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

One method of developing inclusive instructional experiences is through the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, wherein teachers proactively design instruction for the broadest range of learners. Doing so may be challenging as elementary teachers may not be familiar with the UDL framework or may not have experience with applying UDL within CS/CT instruction. The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate how four elementary teachers provided UDL-based instruction to academically diverse learners during CS/CT instruction. Teachers received professional development and instructional coaching related to UDL within CS/CT education. Data included teachers' lesson plans, coaching logs, and teacher interviews which were qualitatively analyzed and triangulated. Data revealed that teachers generally addressed all three UDL principles, with an emphasis on two of the principles (multiple means of engagement and multiple means of representing content) above the third principle (multiple means of action and expression). They focused on breaking tasks into steps, emphasizing student choice, and presenting information in multiple ways.

  abstract = {This paper examines K-12 teacher perspectives on the promise and challenges of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education for all students across three states and three school districts-one rural, one suburban, and one urban. Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design. Discussion section points to how these preliminary surveys and focus groups with teachers offer an early predictor in terms of how each district develops its own K-12 computing pathway, with the expectation that such focus groups offer a powerful research/evaluation protocol that can be repeated annually among districts to gauge to what extent teachers' hope (and concerns) about comprehensive K-12 computing pathways are warranted. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Efforts to broaden participation in computing have revealed the need for a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding of how girls of color form computing identities. In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential. © 2020 IEEE.}},

Thus we ask, could a hackathon be used specifically within a CS1 class to motivate students and boost their performance (measured in grades)? In this article, we analyze data from 1253 students before and after an educational hackathon, observing changes in motivation towards the class and ultimately the students' grades. We discovered that although there are variations in motivation and performance on those attending the Pyweekend, either as participants or attendants (general public), it is difficult to conclude that those variations are solely caused by the hackathon.

  abstract = {The ever-increasing computational requirements of HPC and service provider applications are becoming a great challenge for hardware and software designers. These requirements are reaching levels where the isolated development on either computational field is not enough to deal with such challenge. A holistic view of the computational thinking is therefore the only way to success in real scenarios. However, this is not a trivial task as it requires, among others, of hardware–software codesign. In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards. Additionally, we show that computing of an approximate result by reducing the communication overhead can yield 23% performance gains for double-precision data sets. © The Author(s) 2017.}},

  abstract = {Teaching students to become skillful problem solvers is a goal of university education, but it has been difficult to measure such skill or demonstrate the benefits of particular educational experiences. This paper presents a study of college students solving a problem unrelated to their academic majors. The analysis suggests that the educational experiences of Computer Science (CS) students may better train them in problem-solving than the experiences of other majors. In this study, students from a variety of undergraduate majors and grade levels were given a 15-minute problem-solving task embedded in an interactive science simulation. The complex task calls upon many problem-solving practices needed by scientists and engineers in their professions. Although this task has little resemblance to the problems encountered in a computer science course, CS students performed significantly better than students in any other major. In addition, only for CS students was there an indication of improvement in problem-solving from lower to upper grade levels. We propose that general problem-solving and computational thinking share some common practices, such as problem decomposition and comprehensive data collection. Furthermore, we present preliminary evidence that training in computational thinking is transferable to problem-solving tasks across domains and discuss how the unique features of CS programming assignments could be generalized to other science and engineering courses to foster students' general problem-solving skills. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

They were then assigned a series of challenges that required developing progressively more advanced cybersecurity measures to protect their robots. This culminated in a final challenge that required implementing defensive measures such as encryption, secure key exchange, and sequence numbers to prevent cyber attacks during robot operations.We used an evidencecentered design framework to construct rubrics for grading student work. The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts. These results correlate with scores from the game and the final challenge. Overall, surveys show that the competition-based robotics learning framework was engaging to students, and it supported their learning.

  abstract = {Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Recent studies of creative cognition have revealed interactions between functional brain networks involved in the generation of novel ideas; however, the neural basis of creativity is highly complex and presents a great challenge in the field of cognitive neuroscience, partly because of ambiguity around how to assess creativity. We applied a novel computational method of verbal creativity assessment—semantic distance— and performed weighted degree functional connectivity analyses to explore how individual differences in assembly of resting-state networks are associated with this objective creativity assessment. To measure creative performance, a sample of healthy adults (n = 175) completed a battery of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, in which they were asked to think of unusual uses for everyday objects. Computational semantic models were applied to calculate the semantic distance between objects and responses to obtain an objective measure of DT performance. All participants underwent resting-state imaging, from which we computed voxel-wise connectivity matrices between all gray matter voxels. A linear regression analysis was applied between DT and weighted degree of the connectivity matrices. Our analysis revealed a significant connectivity decrease in the visual-temporal and parietal regions, in relation to increased levels of DT. Link-level analyses showed higher local connectivity within visual regions was associated with lower DT, whereas projections from the precuneus to the right inferior occipital and temporal cortex were positively associated with DT. Our results demonstrate differential patterns of resting-state connectivity associated with individual creative thinking ability, extending past work using a new application to automatically assess creativity via semantic distance. © 2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}},

  abstract = {The basic cognitive architecture of our brain is still unknown. However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

  abstract = {Students repeatedly find programming a complex subject to grasp and this can be compounded when teaching within a computer game context. Comprehending the concept of programming beyond the syntax of the chosen programming language can present many barriers for the student to overcome. Students frequently associate the term "programming" with the creation of "text-based" language-specific code neglecting the associated problem-solving activities of developing pseudocode algorithms, computational thinking, problem identification and pattern recognition. Specialising the programming for games can persuade students to neglect problem-solving activities and perceive the programming fundamentals taught in introductory first-level courses as not applicable. Suggesting that the teaching methodology employed at an introductory level does not meet the needs of the student. Various academic studies would suggest there is a need for an approach to programming that brings together as many, if not all, the cognitive aspects of programming - pseudocode algorithms, computational thinking, problem identification, pattern recognition as well as the development of coded solutions. The Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify and Make (PRIMM) approach carefully developed for effective use in schools lends itself nicely for use in a game programming setting. The PRIMM approach is predicated on the spheres of programming research - Use-Modify-Create, Levels of Abstraction, and reading and tracing code for understanding. It provides a framework for the educator to administer "scaffolded" and directed exercises to the student to aid their understanding. Although developed as a general pedagogy for teaching the fundamental aspects of programming, the methodology provides an approach that could improve the teaching and delivery of game programming modules. This paper will discuss an initial attempt to improve the teaching and student understanding of games programming through the application of the PRIMM methodology to the module delivery. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

  abstract = {This paper presents research about supporting primary school teachers in planning game based learning activities in different school subjects. Teachers can describe learning activities in the form of a learning scenario, which usually includes a list of learning outcomes, teaching methods and strategies, materials, and tools for achieving the learning outcomes. The process of designing a learning scenario can be challenging for teachers, especially those with a lack of ICT skills. Teachers should be familiar with the various ICT based teaching methods, strategies, contents and tools. Therefore, it is necessary to organize educational programmes to support teachers in acquiring appropriate knowledge and skills. The paper describes results of the study conducted during the education for primary school junior grade teachers organized within the Erasmus+ project GLAT that promotes development of algorithmic thinking using games. The aim of the study was to identify the level of participants' knowledge and skills needed to design scenarios with game based learning activities for developing algorithmic and computational thinking among their students. Using questionnaires, the teachers' self-assessment of familiarity with the terminology related to game based learning and possibilities of adapting and using digital contents, games and tools was determined as well as their self-assessment of progress made during the education. Teachers' progress was realized to the greatest extent for elements related to games, learning scenarios, and applying Web 2.0 tools for learning activities. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the GLAT instructional model and showed that teachers need support not only through education, but also by providing ICT tools that will make the process of designing learning scenarios easier for them. Therefore, a future work in this direction is planned within the project Digital games and will include development of a web application for guiding teachers in the process of designing innovative game based learning scenarios. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

  abstract = {Game development-based learning and creative coding activities are seen as an opportunity for young people to acquire programming skills and overall, Computational Thinking (CT) skills in an entertaining way. The goal of such activities is to create playable gaming artefacts. While learning to code is becoming more and more important, young game design-ers miss a clear map to know how game and design elements can be organized and in which situations, specific elements or structures are appropriate. The aim of this paper is to present a valid assessment for structuring games created with visual coding languages. In different workshop settings (out-off school workshops, school workshops) 84 participants between 10 and 15 years old have individually created gaming applications with our Catrobat environment. Games created during these workshops (2017-2019) were analysed and structured in game elements, design elements, and game complexity. This method is based on various existing frameworks, for example, the Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) framework, which provide a consistent structure to define game elements, goals, and rules, thereby delivering a common framework and vocabulary for games. The transfer of game concepts in a consistent structure should support the overall clarity of the game and should help to focus students on the relevant elements of games. We argue that students need guidelines to be able to implement more complex games even with visual programming languages. The result, the Playing, Engagement, Creativity, and Creating (PECC) Assessment Template should support the process of evaluating gaming apps in visual coding languages, can be used by researchers as a valid method for structuring games, helps all students to adhere to good game design principles, and teachers can use the analysis to evaluate games created with visual programming languages. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered to be a fundamental skill underlying not only programming ability, but also an entire array of computational problem-solving competencies in a data-driven world. The need for accessible and engaging educational tools for CT has recently been acknowledged as significant by educational authorities. Glitchspace is a first-person puzzle game where the player has to manipulate objects in the game world through a visual programming interface in order to escape the cybermaze and win. The game received critical acclaim for its innovative and engaging gameplay, including a British Academy Scotland Award (BAFTA). However, the educational potential of Glitchspace in relation to CT ability has not been sufficiently explored. As success at playing the game relies on the players' ability to program the game world to suit their goals, it is hypothesised that common measurements of CT will positively correlate with game ability (measured by game metrics, such as completion times and number of failed attempts of various sub-tasks). We propose to develop methodologies to explore the relationship between gameplay behaviour and computational problem-solving ability in the game Glitchspace. Such methodologies will allow researchers to investigate which game mechanics elicit and promote CT in a reliable and measurable way. The outcome of this research will be of great value to instructional designers seeking to leverage games for CT education, as well as learning game analysts seeking to map gameplay behaviour to learning outcomes. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

  abstract = {Introducing coding in early education improves the logical and computational thinking in kids. However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills. The research also successfully reduced screen time problem by providing a screen-free student interface. © 2013 IEEE.}},

The structure of a programming language does not cause impose problems to students, the real obstacle is how to apply these learned grammars and present them in a complete and correct program code for problem solving. In this study, a deep learning recommendation system was developed, which includes augmented reality (AR) technology, and learning theory, and is provided for study by students in non-major and also from different learning backgrounds. Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students.

  abstract = {Today's digital society has turned the development of students' computational thinking capabilities into a critical factor for their future success. As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim. © 2013 IEEE.}},

The research design is quasi-experimental, with pretest and post-test measures, with an experimental and control group. The sample of participants consists of 46 students of the first year of Primary Education, with age between 6 and 7 years, belonging to a Spanish educational centre. Computational thinking is measured through the dimensions: algorithmic thinking sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used in the intervention sessions were an adaptation of the training actions proposed in the robotics study program “TangibleK”. The results obtained in this study reveal positive effects concerning the performance achieved by the participants in the activities carried out. This indicates a significant effect on the strengthening of skills linked to computational thinking. The differences found between the pretest and post-test measures of the experimental group are statistically significant and superior to those presented by the control group.

Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests. © 2013 IEEE.}},

Participants used Kodetu's coding blocks to solve challenges of increasing difficulty while we gathered their clickstream in the platform. Here, we present our findings after evaluating these data in regards of participants' characteristics (age, sex, previous knowledge), similarity with previously submitted solutions, and degree of discrepancy from the optimal solution.

  abstract = {Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented. A statistically significant difference was discovered between the first and third cohorts (t = -15.06, p<0.00001), and between the second and third cohorts (t = _27.02, p<0.00001) of the course in lecture video access rates. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  journal = {International Journal of STEM Education}},
  abstract = {Background: There have been increasing calls for integrating computational thinking and computing into school science, mathematics, and engineering classrooms. The learning goals of the curriculum in this study included learning about both computational thinking and climate science. Including computer science in science classrooms also means a shift in the focus on design and creation of artifacts and attendant practices. One such design practice, widespread in the design and arts fields, is critique. This paper explores the role of critique in two urban, heterogenous 8th grade science classrooms in which students engaged in creating computer games on the topic of climate systems and climate change. It explores and compares how practices of critique resulted from curricular decisions to (i) scaffold intentional critique sessions for student game designers and (ii) allow for spontaneous feedback as students interacted with each other and their games during the process of game creation. Results: Although we designed formal opportunities for critique, the participatory dimension of the project meant that students were free to critique each other’s games at any time during the building process and did so voluntarily. Data indicate that students focused much more on the game play dimension of the design than the science, particularly in those critique sessions that were student-initiated. Despite the de-emphasis on science in spontaneous critiques, students still focused on several dimensions of computational thinking, considering user experience, troubleshooting, modeling, and elegance of solutions. Conclusions: Students making games about science topics should have opportunities for both formal and spontaneous critiques. Spontaneous critiques allow for students to be authorities of knowledge and to determine what is acceptable and what is not. However, formal, teacher-designed critiques may be necessary for students to focus on science as part of the critique. Furthermore, one of the benefits to critiquing others was that students were able to see what others had done, how they had set up their games, the content they included, and how they had programmed certain features. Lastly, critiques can help facilitate iteration as students work to improve their games. © 2019, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {Computer scientists have been working towards a common definition of abstraction; however, the instruction and assessment of abstraction remain categorically under-researched. Abstraction is often cited as a component of computational thinking and can be likened to a higher order thinking skill. Most K-12 educators have studied critical thinking (e.g., Bloom's taxonomy, Marzano & Kendall's new taxonomy) more than computational thinking. Overlapping characteristics of abstraction and critical thinking can provide educators with instructional guidance. The qualitative examination of how teachers determine curriculum, deliver instruction, and design assessments in K-12 computer science education contributes insights into current instructional practices and variables for future quantitative study. The instructional strategies, objectives, and assessments of 12 K-12 computer science teachers from three states in the United States were examined in this descriptive qualitative examination of instruction using thematic coding analysis. The majority of teachers interviewed had little to no professional development regarding teaching abstraction. All teachers in the study were unsure what student abstraction abilities should be according to grade level. Teachers' understanding of abstraction ranged from very little knowledge to very knowledgeable. The majority of teachers interviewed did not assess abstraction intentionally. Teachers described successfully teaching abstraction through multiple instructional practices and spiraling curriculum. This examination of abstraction in K-12 computer science education offers practical descriptive insights and illuminates additional variables for researching the instruction of abstraction qualitatively and quantitatively.

In this perspective, active-learning and problem-based learning theories were considered to support the proposal of a series of activities composing a framework to be adopted to achieve the target objectives. The interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes improvement has its roots at the proposal of solutions for problems into disciplines of high school curricula through the innovative m-learning features to be designed and developed by the students.

The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews.

This study contributes to the growing body of research on computation in engineering education by introducing computational concepts and activities during a physics laboratory class. Drawing from Experiential Learning Theory and using an adapted version of the Use-Modify-Create framework for teaching computational thinking, a series of lab activities was designed that combined physical lab experiments with computational modeling using custom-built VPython simulations. Data was collected from the labs in the form of (1) responses to lab activity worksheets, (2) code modified and/or generated by the students during lab activities, (3) in-code comments provided by the students during the activities. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze students' learning benefits and any challenges faced during the activities. While results show a number of learning benefits, an observed homogeneity of student responses to the questions on the lab handouts point to a set of potential limitations within the activities themselves that warranted further examination. Insight gained from this analysis process is presented as a set of four design principles that will inform future implementations of the hybrid course design. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This study explores interactions between computational thinking, gender and engineering identity among biomedical engineering undergraduate students. Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, 'engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers. © 2019 IEEE.}},

Within the discipline of computer science, problem decomposition is recognized as a foundational activity of software development. Factors that contribute to the complexity of this activity include: (1) recognizing patterns within an algorithm, (2) mapping the understanding of an algorithm to the syntax of a given programming language, and (3) complexity intrinsic to the problem domain itself.Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain. Performance on outcome measures (a quiz and assignment) were compared between the new method and the traditional teaching method demonstrated that students were significantly more successful at demonstrating mastery when using the new instructional method. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This paper is focused on the teaching/learning process of Computational Thinking at primary and secondary schools. It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts 'Computational Thinking' and 'Programming', and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {We are witnessing a great effort on the part of the educational systems of the world in modernizing the curricular content of primary and secondary schools. One example of these educational initiatives is the effort of integrating aspects of engineering and technology with the existing core subjects of sciences and mathematic in K-12 education. These efforts are often labeled as STEM or STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Arts.) These subjects, studied in an integral form, are considered essential in the education of the citizens of a modern society. A common obstacle encountered in the implementation of these projects or initiatives is the lack of consensus on the specific topics to be included in the curriculum, the pedagogical methodology selected for the classroom, and the means, computer-based or otherwise, to be used by the teachers and the students. Often the lack of consensus among the different constituencies in charge of these projects finds its roots in the different assumptions made by their participants. This paper addresses one of the most acute set of differences present in these projects: the teaching methods used in class, knowing the resources and limitations of the human mind. In the last few decades we have learned much of how the mind works; what tasks are intrinsically easy or difficult for the human mind. Also, with the extensive access to computing power in our society, it is important to determine if a traditional task was studied in school for its practical use or for its value in developing the potential qualities of the mind. In this paper we will use the word computation in its traditional meaning of symbol manipulation. In that sense, all processes of thinking, solving problems, and endeavors of creation are processes of symbol manipulation, or computation. In this paper we present a computational model of the mind in order to provide a standard reference that will help in finding answers to questions such as: when is a task complex, what are the cognitive capabilities and limitations of the mind, what teaching methodologies are optimal, and why. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual.There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools. © 2019 IEEE.}},

The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15.

Our research interests focus on the assessment of fundamental computational thinking competencies, such as collection, organisation and analysis of data, algorithmic thinking and abstraction. For the needs of our research, we implemented the digital platform PhysGramming, which constitutes the backbone of a relevant assessment tool we have built. PhysGramming is developmentally appropriate for first and second grade primary school students and provides the opportunity to create their own digital games, transforming them from passive consumers to active creators of digital technology. The assessment tool has been applied to 450 students in the first and second grade of primary schools on Crete, Greece from February to June 2019. The research was conducted attuned to the ethical guidelines of educational research, within the framework of the physical and natural science courses and evolved around three axes: (a) Checking the validity and the reliability of the results that come out when applying the proposed assessment tool. (b) Designating the levels of computational thinking skills of students at first stages of schooling. (c) Checking the correlation between the levels of computational thinking skills and the comprehension of the lesson's content. In other words, we check whether high learning performance is a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosing high levels of basic computational thinking skills.

The results indicate that participants' attitudes towards Computing has become more positive after the course, primarily their comprehension of CT and confidence to learn Computer Science.

Quantitative research methodology is applied on empirical data obtained on non-Computer Science students (Non-CS) in a HE institution in UAE. There is a correlation between in university (InUni) Maths skills and Python programming course's performance. Compared to Engineering students, Business students may found it more challenging to learn Python programming language, which also applies to their Maths skills.

A curriculum mapping of 63 undergraduate courses was conducted with course learning outcomes aligned against two benchmarks. The first benchmark was the Ten Skills for the Future Workforce which identifies key employability skills graduates will require in the coming decade. The second benchmark was the Australian Qualifications Framework Specification for the Bachelor Degree which defines the generic skills graduates must obtain through Australian Bachelor Degrees. This curriculum mapping reveals that Australian music technology courses teach Novel and Adaptive Thinking, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, and Design Mindsets universally. However, this curriculum mapping also reveals a deficit in employability skills related to Cross-Cultural Competency, Transdisciplinarity, Virtual Collaboration, and Collaboration more generally. The implications of this mapping is that Australian music technology educators seem to be prioritizing specific technical and creative skills over higher-order applications of skills and knowledge which are contextualized in their broader social and cultural contexts.

  abstract = {This article takes inspiration from Kittler’s claim that philosophy has neglected the means used for its production. Kittler’s argument for media ontology will be compared to the post-Kantian project of re-inventing philosophy through the medium of thought (in particular Deleuze’s Spiritual Automaton). The article discusses these views in the context of the automation of logical thinking where procedures, tasks, and functions are part of the instrumental processing of new ends evolving a new mode of reasoning. In particular, the article suggests that in constructivist logic and information theory, the temporal gap between truth and proof, between input and output, can be taken to argue that the means of thought expose the indetermination or the incomputability of proof. The automation of reasoning in logical processing coincides not with mindless correlations of data, replacing axioms with data, truths with self-validating proofs. Instead, the problem of the indeterminacy of proof within automated logic re-habilitates techne or instrumentality, and the relation between means and ends away from classical idealism and analytic realism. By following John Dewey’s argument for instrumentality, it will be argued that the task of thinking today needs to re-invent a logic of techne away from the teleological view of ends or the crisis of finality. If the post-Kantian preoccupations about the task of thinking already announced that the medium of thought could offer possibilities for a non-human philosophy (or a philosophy beyond truth), this article envisions a machine philosophy originating from within computational media. © The Author(s) 2019.}},

The qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. Our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially.

  abstract = {Academic self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards a school subject are relevant for learning and educational achievement. A positive self-concept in science and mathematics is argued to motivate students to persist and advance in studying these subjects. In particular, self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards STEM domains were found to be predictive of educational achievement. Recently, programming was suggested to be a key competence in education. To assess self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming, we developed a new questionnaire based on existing scales for mathematics. The new questionnaire assesses the same aspects for programming on seven subscales, such as self-concept, belief about usefulness, and self-reported persistence when working on programming tasks. We conducted a pilot study in which we used this questionnaire to measure self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming. The study was set in the context of an extracurricular course on computational thinking (CT) for elementary school students between the ages of seven and ten years. Before the start of the course, we assessed all 31 participating students' self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming using the developed questionnaire and their CT skills using the Computational Thinking test (CTt). Our results confirmed the expected associations between the aspects assessed by our questionnaire. However, we did not find significant associations of questionnaire results and CT skills. Consequently, future research involving a larger sample is needed to better understand the association between children's actual performance and their self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

The process of problem solving was divided into several operable steps to gradually guide students to analyze problems, provide solutions and establish scientific logic thinking. Blockly was introduced to obscure the grammar of programming language and implement the algorithm visually. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PBL-VP teaching method on student learning by a contrast test. The empirical results proved that students in the class with PBL-VP earned higher final grades and the teaching method we proposed played a positive role in computer general education. © 2019 IEEE.}},

Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret-a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence-is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which-after new reward evidence-an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking. © 2019 IEEE.}},

Despite its increasing popularity, the construct itself is only partially understood. There are few measures currently in place that advance our understanding of computational thinking and its sub-constructs. In this article, we analyze existing measures of computational thinking (CT), looking specifically at their measures of decomposition. Decomposition is defined as the process of breaking down a problem into its sub-components. Even though most definitions of computational thinking include decomposition, few break down the decompositional process beyond a basic definition. As one of the first steps in the computational thinking process, it is important to better understand the various manners in which decomposition occurs, which methods are most effective, and under what conditions. To better understand the decompositional process, we analyze evidence of decompositional process in a variety of disciplines. We then present a framework for decomposition in computational thinking. We demonstrate how this framework may help educators to better prepare students to break down complex problems, as well as provide guidance for how decompositional ability might be measured. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

  abstract = {Non-programmers, in particular, those who identify as female or gender-diverse, experience many factors that hinder their ultimate interest, participation, and success in programming. Prior work has delved into the problem of underrepresentation in STEM and specifically in Computing Education to uncover the barriers impacting these groups. Yet, attraction and retention remains a challenge. I argue that while formal learning pathways are critical to increasing participation of diverse learners, it is also integral to provide informal and non-formal learning opportunities as well. My research uses mixed-methods within a design-based research approach to offer and evaluate an active learning beginners’ programming workshop called Code For Her. The workshop is designed to introduce females and gender-diverse individuals to web development. My goal is to analyze participants’ experiences and progress within a trajectory framework, producing a narrative of their behaviors and attitudes over both short-term and longer-term intervals. In a pilot study of the workshop design, I observed increases in self-efficacy and positive attitudes, as well as changes in ways of thinking about computing. I note that the brief exposure of a workshop may seed understanding and skills in computation, but is not likely to convert non-programmers into programmers. Instead, I am exploring a new construct - computational grounding - that refers to participants’ enhanced orientation toward computing-related behaviors. I will operationalize and study this construct using the workshop activities, thereby enhancing discussions of computational thinking. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

  abstract = {Studies with augmented reality show that while the technology helps the student learn, it may end up disturbing other points, showing that more research is needed with the use of augmented reality. Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children. © 2019 IEEE.}},

This work presents a CS project called ForestEyes, which proposes to track deforestation in rainforests by asking volunteers to analyze and classify remote sensing images. These manually classified data are used as input for training a pattern classifier that will be used to label new remote sensing images. ForestEyes project was created on the Zooniverse.org CS platform, and to attest the quality of the volunteers' answers, were performed early campaigns with remote sensing images from Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA). The results were processed and compared to an oracle classification (PRODES-Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project). Two and a half weeks after launch, more than 35,000 answers from 383 volunteers (117 anonymous and 266 registered users) were received, completing all 2050 tasks. The ForestEyes campaigns' results have shown that volunteers achieved excellent effectiveness results in remote sensing image classification task.

This leads to asking: Is the doer effect similar when experienced learners are compared to novices? Is it present, regardless of the topic being taught? We find the doer effect varies in magnitude across learners of different experience level and topics, suggesting that the importance of practice depends on the topic and the learner's background.

  abstract = {The increasing demand for higher data rates and for more connected devices has led to Massive MIMO (MMIMO) Technology. The large number of antennas makes the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector infeasible to be implemented due to high complexity, despite its optimal performance. Sphere Decoder (SD) has a bit error rate (BER) performance similar to ML detector, therefore making it more efficient (0.5-1.25 dB gain) than Linear Detectors (LD), proposed in the literature. However, the low complexity of LD and the non-deterministic behavior of SD are the main reasons that prohibit the use of sphere decoding methods in MMIMO systems. The results of this paper disrupt conventional thinking and show that there may be a future for SD in certain MMIMO system. The number of visited nodes during detection and the Initial Radius (IR) method are crucial for the computational complexity of SD. In this paper, an effective IR method, decreasing significantly the complexity and the number of visited nodes is proposed. Furthermore an optimization at tree searching further reduces the number of visited nodes, where in combination with an implementation featured with one-node-per-cycle architecture minimize the latency and make the SD attainable to large-scale systems for Eb/N0≥ 4 dB. Hardware aspects are investigated for both a Virtex-7 FPGA and a 28 nm ASIC technology. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can explore common, vast and unsafe places at low cost. They could transform multiple sectors from photography to farming to city planning. However, the software underlying UAS is complex and requires multiple distinct programming skills, e.g., AI, machine learning and flight control. Few programmers encompass these skills, hampering software development and dampening the impact of UAS. We contend that early exposure to UAS software could help align workforce skills. However, early exposure requires curriculum that (1) captures the breadth of UAS software, (2) supports multiple levels of depth for diverse programming backgrounds and (3) fits within resource and institutional challenges. We propose a computational thinking framework. In our approach, lessons fit within 20-30 minute instructional blocks, making them usable in short workshop and extended classroom settings. UAV topics and computational thinking depth link lessons. Teachers can trade breadth for in-depth coding and vice versa. In early work, we presented an autonomous UAS to middle school students. Our 1 hour workshop focused on breadth and was received well. © 2019 IEEE.}},

Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning.

  abstract = {The concept of computational thinking is timely. It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking.

Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures.We measured students' perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task.We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

This goal presents a key challenge for assessing student learning: we must identify assessment items associated with an emergent understanding of key cognitive abilities underlying CT that avoid specialized knowledge of specific programming languages. In this work we explore the psychometric properties of assessment items appropriate for use with middle grades (US grades 6-8; ages 11-13) students. We also investigate whether these items measure a single ability dimension. Finally, we strive to recommend a “lean” set of items that can be completed in a single 50-minute class period and have high face validity. The paper makes the following contributions: 1) adds to the literature related to the emerging construct of CT, and its relationship to the existing CTt and Bebras instruments, and 2) offers a research-based CT assessment instrument for use by both researchers and educators in the field. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

Large-scale analysis of compilation and runtime errors have been used in introductory programming courses and similar approaches can be used to understand learning in web development environments. We investigated activity logs of a novel web coding game to uncover learning trajectories and what people struggle with when learning flexible box (flexbox), a collection of new CSS layout features. We designed a game called Flexbox Froggy, in which learners solve challenges by writing a few lines of CSS code, moving from simple levels that require knowledge of one flexbox property, to complex levels combining multiple properties. We investigate learning curves based on the changes in syntactic and semantic errors learners make as they complete the game. Our findings show that people performed better encountering a single new property than combined with properties they had already practiced. Clusters of learners at different levels did not demonstrate expected error rates based on learning curve theory. Also unexpectedly, advanced groups that mastered syntax had higher semantic error rates than the beginner group, especially when attempting new properties or complex use cases. We conclude with implications for designing and developing introductory web programming games and other instructional materials. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games. © 2019 IEEE.}},

The project is among the first to examine the linguistic and sociocultural factors that facilitate the success of multilingual students in mastering computational thinking. Utilizing principles of Design-Based Implementation Research in alignment with the RPP approach, researchers worked collaboratively with teachers and administrators to identify problems of practice in computer science education specific to the district. A broad survey of national and regional computer science initiatives was conducted to identify effective approaches for teaching computational thinking to diverse learners. As a result of this survey, the RPP identified a pathbreaking curriculum that aligns with the Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 standards to pilot in five classrooms in the first year of the RPP. The curriculum was further revised to align with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and the California English Language Development standards during a week-long summer institute. This paper describes these experiences, highlighting the integration of computational thinking into an English Language Arts curriculum as well as the linguistic scaffolding strategies utilized to better meet the needs of multilingual students.

Since the 1980s, computational systems of information processing have evolved to include not only deductive methods of decision, whereby results are already implicated in their premises, but have crucially shifted towards an adaptive practice of learning from data, an inductive method of retrieving information from the environment and establishing general premises. This shift in logical methods of decision-making does not simply concern technical apparatuses, but is a symptom of a transformation in logical thinking activated with and through machines.

One of the intended learning outcomes of the programme is to improve CT practices of teachers, which is one of the three key elements in the CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick. Assessing one's CT practices is challenging because there is no universally agreed-upon assessment method on CT practices in the existing literature. This study adopted the Evidence-centered Assessment Design (ECD) method to design test questions to evaluate teachers' development of CT practices. This study provided two Teacher Development Courses (TDCs) to enable teachers to teach CT through programming. TDC 1 focused on developing CT concepts, practices and perspectives of teachers, while TDC 2 put emphasis on pedagogies of teaching CT. 80 teachers participated in the two courses. The CT practices tests were administered before the courses, between the two courses and after the courses respectively. Results indicated that CT practices were improved progressively when the in-service teachers attended the two courses. It indicated that it is useful for teachers to experience programming practices in their initial learning as well as during their pedagogical development. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

With this, the goal is to encourage children to have better analytical skills, to awake computational thinking, and to increase interest in programming through incentives and recognition. © 2019 IEEE.}},

The bases of computational thinking will be developed through dynamics and games, in this way children will not get bored and learn by playing. The second stage is aimed at students from 3rd grade to 6th grade. It consists in introducing the basic concepts of the computation and the use of Scratch once the computational thinking was developed when they were smaller.

Students solved visual design problems by creating 3D sculptures in an online virtual environment.

To achieve the desired design, students use programming and computing concepts, such as loops, to solve those visual design centered problems, i.e. solving for composition, positive/negative space, balance, as opposed to computational problems first, i.e. create a loop, a fractal, randomized lines, etc. We present results from a study conducted on three high school summer courses. We compared the use of our Visual Design Problem-based teaching strategy (students wrote code to solve challenges based on art and design principles) to a traditional strategy (students wrote code to demonstrate comprehension of computer science concepts). Our results showed that test scores were higher for students in our Visual Design Problem-based courses.

  abstract = {Over the past decade, politicians, leaders, and pundits have called for computing and computer science education opportunities to be made available earlier and earlier. Such calls have led to the creation of a wide variety of offerings for students at middle-school and even elementary levels, including summer “code camps” targeted at middle-school students. Such camps often emphasize fun aspects of computing, such as games and robots. In contrast, research at the collegiate level suggests that meaningful applications of computing, such as computing for social good, are more successful at building and sustaining interest, particularly among students from groups traditionally underrepresented in computing. In this project, we developed and offered a summer camp that draws upon ideas and approaches from the digital humanities (DH), which explore the use of algorithms and computation in support of broader humanistic inquiry. Because DH reveals different ways to apply algorithmic and computational thinking, DH has the potential to attract students who might not otherwise consider computing. In this paper, we introduce central issues in the digital humanities, explain the rationale for the camp design, describe the camp curriculum, and reflect on successful and less successful aspects of the camp. Among other things, we consider how to introduce digital humanities topics to students who have not yet heard the term “humanities” and explore the utility of such topics for this age group. We also present preliminary data on the short-term effects of the camp on students' self-efficacy and interest in computing. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

We conducted a rigorous analysis of scholarly research on K-8 computer science education to extract what concepts in debugging students should and are capable of learning.

In this paper, we describe the three dimensions of debugging that emerged during the creation of the trajectory: (1) strategies for finding and fixing errors, (2) types of errors, and (3) the role of errors in problem solving. In doing so, we go beyond identification of specific debugging strategies to further articulate knowledge that would help students understand when to use those techniques and why they are successful.

In order to improve teaching quality, in this paper, we discuss the deployment of an inexpensive in-house Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) cloud platform, which can provide students with hardware-software co-design methodology and practice. The platform includes 32 FPGA nodes and the scale can be dynamically changed. Each cloud node is heterogeneously composed of an ARM processor and a tightly-coupled reconfigurable fabric to provide students with hands-on hardware and software programming experiences. We illustrate our efforts to make the FPGA cloud as an easy-to-use resource pool to elastically support a class with 92 undergrads via Internet access and to monitor students experimental behaviors. We also present key insights in our teaching activities that indicate such appliance is feasible to provide practice of both basic principles and emerging co-design techniques for students.

  abstract = {In recent years, a growing number of universities have begun to offer specialized courses as a way to make computer science (CS) more accessible to students with little or no prior CS or programming experience, especially non-CS majors. One of the ways courses have been modified for these students is by supplementing the core problem solving and coding aspects of the curriculum with explicit instruction on computational thinking principles. These “computational thinking” courses are promising in that they ground computational thinking in discipline-specific contexts and emphasize application of computational principles. However, there is little empirical research evaluating the extent to which students learn computational thinking from these courses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an online Computational Creativity course on students' computational thinking skills, creative competencies, and self-efficacy. Students in the Computational Creativity course were predominantly non-CS majors, and they completed four Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) that have previously been shown to improve learning and achievement. Results indicate that the Computational Creativity course was effective in increasing students' computational thinking knowledge and self-efficacy for applying computational thinking in their fields, but it did not have an impact on students' creative competencies. Additionally, students' reactions to the course and the CCEs were mostly positive. Thus, this study provides initial evidence that non-CS majors can learn computational thinking through the online Computational Creativity course. © 2019 Association of Computing Machinery.}},

However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course. © 2013 IEEE.}},

The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In service to the state of the art, advances are required toward redesigning the framework over which web applications are built. The semantic web lies at the intersection of web and machine understandable meaningful data, turning it into intelligent 'web of data'. The key requirement with any intelligent system has been to find a concrete knowledge representation that can make the inferences within time and space constraints; that is, reasoning effectively and efficiently within the resource constraints posed to the problem at one hand and with insufficient data as well as incomplete knowledge on the other hand. Various Knowledge representation schemes have been proposed in the literature, each having its limitation over the others. Ontology is the key component for semantic web engineering. Ontologies are conceptual knowledge bases providing a systematic and taxonomical description of the concepts and instances under consideration. Conceptual clarity in the computational representation of a concept is vital for holistic thinking and knowledge engineering. In order to meet the needs of an application/enterprise, knowledge should be presented taking care of all possible perspectives; and represented in a hierarchical structure with differing levels of granularity. This paper discusses about bringing all the manifestations of an ontological concept/decision under one umbrella; hence describing the resultant scheme as a unit of knowledge. By representing a concept as a knowledge unit, classical ontology is claimed to be sufficient in dealing with imprecise, vague and heterogeneous knowledge for real-world web applications; and portrays the capability to acquire fresh knowledge through its thorough interaction with the external world in a given working environment. © 2019 River Publishers.}},

  abstract = {Frequencies from 100 GHz to 3 THz are promising bands for the next generation of wireless communication systems because of the wide swaths of unused and unexplored spectrum. These frequencies also offer the potential for revolutionary applications that will be made possible by new thinking, and advances in devices, circuits, software, signal processing, and systems. This paper describes many of the technical challenges and opportunities for wireless communication and sensing applications above 100 GHz, and presents a number of promising discoveries, novel approaches, and recent results that will aid in the development and implementation of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, and beyond. This paper shows recent regulatory and standard body rulings that are anticipating wireless products and services above 100 GHz and illustrates the viability of wireless cognition, hyper-accurate position location, sensing, and imaging. This paper also presents approaches and results that show how long distance mobile communications will be supported to above 800 GHz since the antenna gains are able to overcome air-induced attenuation, and present methods that reduce the computational complexity and simplify the signal processing used in adaptive antenna arrays, by exploiting the Special Theory of Relativity to create a cone of silence in over-sampled antenna arrays that improve performance for digital phased array antennas. Also, new results that give insights into power efficient beam steering algorithms, and new propagation and partition loss models above 100 GHz are given, and promising imaging, array processing, and position location results are presented. The implementation of spatial consistency at THz frequencies, an important component of channel modeling that considers minute changes and correlations over space, is also discussed. This paper offers the first in-depth look at the vast applications of THz wireless products and applications and provides approaches for how to reduce power and increase performance across several problem domains, giving early evidence that THz techniques are compelling and available for future wireless communications. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering}},
  abstract = {Programming by demonstration (PBD) transforms the robot programming from the code level to automated interface between robot and human, promoting the flexibility of robotized automation. In this paper, we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal, an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill, called MASD, is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect, gesture, and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD, the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time, driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments, the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills, and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD, the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch, verifying the initial hypothesis. Note to Practitioners - In the conventional robotized automation, the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term, with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment. On the other hand, the new trend of customization brings the new characteristics: production in short cycle and small volume. This irreversible momentum urges the robot to switch from task to task efficiently. The biggest bottleneck here is the tedious programming, which also has high prerequisites for most practitioners in manufacturing. This situation motivates the development of a PBD system that can understand the assembly skills performed by the human experts in the demonstration and accordingly generate the program for robot's execution of the taught task. In this paper, we present a skill decoding system to parse the observational raw demonstration into symbolic sequences, which is the crucial bridge to enable the automatic programming. The system achieves high performance in recognition and is tailored for the PBD in assembly tasks by considering both advantages and disadvantages in the background of assembly, such as controllable environment and limited computational resources. It is particularly useful for assembly tasks with modularized actions based on a set of standard parts. At the perspective of industrial application, the PBD upon the proposed system is a promising solution to improve the flexibility of manufacture, which is expected to be true in midterm but an important step toward this goal. © 2004-2012 IEEE.}},

In addition, many studies and researches are being done related to practices and tools that can be applied in order to retain students that applied for computer science courses. In order to contribute to these initiatives, this paper presents CODEX, an interactive and ludic learning object, that aims to help students that do not need to have a background in programming to learn one of the most important structure in a programming language, the loop.

I do so in response to some of the problems and consequences of the lack of viable theoretical foundations; especially in relation to the development in recent years of many educational practices that claim the term "computational thinking". I therefore introduce my extension of Jean Piaget's general law of cognition which arose as a result of my empirical research on novice learners knowledge of the concept of a program as an executable object. Said empirical study is briefly described in this paper as a means to highlight the key to my extension of Piaget's general law, which is the insight of how the thought processes and methods involved in cases where the subject must instruct an action to a computer differ from those in which the subject instructs another subject, or performs the action themselves. My theory explains the difference between algorithmic thinking and computational thinking by adequately locating it in the specificities of the subject instructing a computer. Hence, in this article I claim that my extension of Piaget's law offers a more empirically thorough and theoretically sound way forward in the conceptual development of "computational thinking" than the alternatives that are being debated in academia to the present day. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

Binary logic and elementary first order propositional calculus are an important aspect of language and seems to have little in common with the perception of objects in space. Nevertheless, we show that classical logic can be derived from the primeval concept of orientation that has emerged in human cognition during Paleolithic worship activity. From there, all higher thought structures can be developed. Thought is a neuronal filter for the perception of that which is.

However, the issue of assessing student's learning of CT remains a challenging one: it is indeed not clear how to achieve a comprehensive evaluation that is able to assess not only the technical and domain-specific skills, but also the domain-independent meta-skills of CT. Finding a solution to this issue is crucial, because assessment not only determines whether or not educational goals are being met, but also supports the design of a curriculum. Multiple forms of assessments have been proposed within the main perspective of programming skills, neglecting the possible generalization of CT training on other skills. In this work, we first review the existing approaches to CT assessment. Then, we discuss what non-technical skills (relational skills and cognitive life-skills) should be included in a comprehensive CT assessment framework. Moreover, we provide an indication of possible solutions to capitalize on the existing experiences in order to achieve a feasible integration of different types of assessment. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

The learning process differentiates two qualitative ways of dealing with this process: the deep approach and the superficial approach. The use of each approach depends on the context. However, the adoption of a deep learning approach is positively related to the academic performance. Computational Thinking is defined as a competence of the XXI century, which allows solving problems from a computational point of view, and there is a variety of instruments that allow to measure it, and to know the state in which the evaluated student is. In this paper, we verified the existence of the positive significant relationship between the learning approach and computational thinking in students entering the career of Computer Sciences. By applying Pearson correlation test to verify the relationship between Learning Approaches and Computational Thinking, we found that both variables have homogeneous behaviors and that students show similar conditions. Men are in better conditions than women on the evaluated aspects of the Computational Thinking, Also, we found a significantly positive relationship between Computational Thinking and the Learning Approach (r = 0,882).

Such tools allows the user to program while manipulating blocks that represent programming languages instructions. iVProg is among this class of tools and was firstly implemented in Java and could be integrated to Moodle using iAssign. Due to technological evolution, iVProg also evolved to iVProgH and its integration to Moodle is still possible by using the new version of iAssign that allow the integration of HTML stack packages to Moodle. In this paper we describe how this evolution takes place and presents iVProgH functionalities as well as iAssign extension to include HTML packages into Moodle. In addition, we give some teaching support whenever integrated using iVProgH with Moodle using iAssign. © 2018 IEEE.}},

This paper focuses on open-ended student comments, both to see if they provide additional insights about the assignments and student perceptions not apparent from the Likert-scaled responses, and to see if these comments are consistent with the results from the prior work. We surveyed over 1000 students who had used pencil-puzzle-based assignments and invited them to make open-ended comments in their survey responses. We used grounded theory to develop codes for the large volume of student survey comments, as well as for semi-structured interviews with the instructors and focus groups with student TAs. Statistical analysis of the coded comments identified several interesting relationships, such as students being appreciative of their learning even when they perceived the assignments as difficult, which were not available from the Likert-scaled data. The analysis also confirmed that these assignments are largely gender- and experience-neutral.

Physical computing is a potential solution that provides ample opportunities for creative development of such skills. The availability of pre-Assembled physical computing tool kits often do not offer the right level of abstraction and flexibility to suit educator's needs. Consequently, this paper presents the design of a custom physical computing tool kit, T{h}inker, primarily for learning and teaching computational thinking and programming skills. Prior to design discussions, the context and motivation behind designing T{h}inker has been presented.

  abstract = {Brain interfaces are cyber-physical systems that aim to harvest information from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information about the underlying processes, and decide/actuate accordingly. Nonetheless, the brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and 'typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based a priori knowledge about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number of training samples. © 2018 IEEE.}},

However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students.

Despite worldwide efforts to promote gender equality, typically, women account for less than 30% of the workforce in technological areas. In third world countries, the situation is much more unbalanced. Poor educational and economic conditions, allied with a chauvinism culture contaminated by sexism and stereotypes, are strong forces that repel the young girls from IT areas. As a result, the percentage of women in local Computer Science majors is lower than expected. The authors detail a program to involve girls from all school levels in computer science career, which is indeed the adaptation of a national program, combined with indigenous elements. The mentioned adaptation was a key success factor to catch the attention of students and local educators. Some activities that are included in this program are lectures at scientific, technological and gender discussion events, realization of dynamics in schools for the dissemination of computational thinking in children and young students, training students to take part in programming contests and develop knowledge into real computational applications. These actions resulted in highlights achieved in programming contests and prizes obtained through application development, and have provided a more conducive academic environment to discuss issues related to the female gender in science and technology fields. Besides the fundamentals of the program, the authors present the results of the last three initiatives, which happened in conjunction with local events, and the promising opportunities perceived in Computer Science major of a local university. © 2018 IEEE.}},

With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a 'filter' that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules. The concepts introduced in the platform are universal enough to be successfully employed in other geographical regions with different student demographics. © 2018 IEEE.}},

However, the relationship of computational thinking to intelligence – seen as the general ability to understand and solve complex problems – is contestable and has not been extensively explored. The present study addressed the question of how computational thinking is related to intelligence. To find an answer to this question, 71 pre-service teacher students completed a survey with 20 Bebras tasks as a measure of computational thinking and a non-verbal intelligence test (TONI-3) to assess their general problem-solving ability. The large and significant correlation of r(70) = .53, p < .001, indicates that both concepts are highly related. Implications of the findings are discussed, including the meaning of the relationship between computational thinking and intelligence during teaching and assessment, and the possibility of more holistic measures of computational thinking that incorporate procedural aspects. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).}},

In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum.

The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution.

  abstract = {Increasing globalization of the world leads to an emerging need for ways to analysis and understand groups from different cultures and ideologies. Researchers have used written text as a medium to examine political discourse and analyze value-motivated groups. Previous works showed that computational linguistic analysis can be performed to infer the flexibility of value-motivated groups from their writings. The main premise of these works is that text can bring insights into individuals' and groups' way of thinking, and potentially, behaviour. While existing works provide viable solutions for characterizing groups' ideological behaviour, they perform their analyses over all text published by the groups. However, researchers have found that religious and value-motivated groups can't be analyzed collectively as they regularly evolve. To address this gap, we analyze the performance of existing methods to single documents. Experimental results show that previous features (e.g., use of pronouns and judgment statements) used to predict groups' flexibility are less predictive for single documents' flexibility. We show that a newly added feature regarding the identity of a group provides a significant contribution to the prediction process. Furthermore, due to the unbalanced nature of our data, we propose a weighting scheme for linear regression based on the inter-group variance. Results indicate that a weighted least squares significantly outperforms a traditional least squares approach. This work brings new insights into the characteristics of different linguistic and performative signals, and their relationship to the linguistic flexibility of groups. It also provides a decision making support tool for practical use by practitioners. © 2018 IEEE.}},

In this paper, the teaching status of the course of Introduction to Algorithmic Design & Analysis in our school was analyzed from the views of students and teachers. Then, aiming at developing students' ability of analyzing and solving problems, specific ideas for curriculum teaching reform were put forward, namely, task module division, teaching content design, visualization teaching based on mind map and problem driven teaching. In addition, specific examples of problem-driven teaching and visualization teaching were also provided. It is worth noting that the introduction of problem-driven cases has promoted students' deep thinking and improved their computational thinking ability. At the same time, the introduction of visual teaching method helps students get better understanding and memory effect. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

  abstract = {This research to practice, work in progress paper presents the analysis strategy used to assess the learning behavior using logs on an e-learning platform. Students who can link algebraic functions to their corresponding graphs perform well in STEM courses. Early algebra curricula teaches these concepts in tandem. However, it is challenging to assess whether students are linking the concepts. Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students. The results of the models with respect to the two types of components of the web portal have been used to infer possible data or graph oriented cognitive bias. © 2018 IEEE.}},

Many of these educators have degrees in disciplines other than computer science, such as math, science, and business, so preparing them to teach CS is a challenge, particularly since most K-12 teachers have limited time to devote to learning new curriculum. This study describes how we managed a short course in computational thinking and programming to a group of high school teachers. We illustrate through survey data assessment and evaluation that significant gains in skill level and self-efficacy can be realized within a short but intensive week of face-to-face training. Five months later we follow-up with the same cohort to see if earlier achievements remain evident over time. Discussion throughout the paper identifies strengths and weaknesses of the training week, which is useful to others planning to undertake similar PD offerings. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Contribution: This paper provides evidence that computational creativity exercises (CCEs) can increase engineering students' learning in introductory computer science (CS1) courses. Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics. © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

The effort proposed and evaluated a novel theory that these decisions are the result of the interaction of four canonical forces - Sympathy, Trust, Fear, and Greed. A computational simulation involving the Stag Hunt game examined information sharing decisions in a series of key decision points in three large case studies. For the five hypotheses tested, exploratory data analysis and nonparametric statistical testing show strong support for three of the hypotheses (cooperation is positively correlated with actors' levels of Sympathy and Trust and negatively correlated with actors' levels of Fear) and moderate support for the fourth (cooperation is negatively correlated with actors' levels of Greed). Indications are that the fifth hypothesis (cooperation is correlated with history of behavior) is not needed to explain observed behavior. Multiple correspondence analysis showed significant interactions both among pairs of forces and when a force is paired with decision making strategies. These results can form the basis for: 1) analysis of additional case studies; 2) development of an agent-based simulation; and 3) creation of training programs for current and future organizational leaders. © 2007-2012 IEEE.}},

The ANFIS model is a fusion of neural networks with learning ability, adaptability, and computational ability, and a fuzzy system with human-like thinking ability and reasoning ability. In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data. Furthermore, we confirmed that the prediction performance of ANFIS model using CFCM clustering method is constant. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking is argued to be an essential skill for the workforce of the 21st century. As a skill, Computational Thinking should be taught in all schools, employing computational ideas integrated into other disciplines. Up until now, questions about how Computational Thinking can be effectively taught have been underexplored preventing efforts to cross the large gap between early adopters and the early majority, conceptualized as the Computer Science Education chasm. A promising strategy to cross the chasm is underway in Switzerland. Switzerland recently introduced a national curriculum, called Lehrplan 21, mandating Computer Science Education. This mandate requires the Computer Science education of elementary and middle school students. In 2017, the School of Education of Northwestern Switzerland (PH FHNW), introduced a mandatory pre-service teacher Computer Science Education course, to satisfy this mandate. All the PH FHNW students who study to become elementary school teachers must pass this two-semester course. The first part of this course was taught for the first time in fall of 2017. This paper presents the philosophy of this course and an initial analysis of both qualitative data capturing the students’ perceptions of Computational Thinking and quantitative data describing shifts in students’ skills and attitudes as effect sizes.

Context: Mapping and analyzing the diversity of experiences and studies that address CTP in K-12 education can bring valuable data to researchers. This work delimits such study to the Brazilian scenario to allow a more in-depth view, given the Brazilian context. Previous surveys and systematic mapping studies present recent publications in major Brazilian computing journals and conferences. Although they offer important contributions, they do not comprehensively cover the Brazilian literature on CTP in K-12 education, since they focus the search in the Brazilian Computer Society publications alone. Objective: This work proposes to characterize the literature on CTP in K-12 education in Brazil. Results: through a systematic mapping study, we collected information on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage and modality, methodological contexts, and used tools and programming languages from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: there is a significant increase in the number of Brazilian studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this research area as well as several trends and gaps to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Educational Robotics (ER) has revealed several benefits in the educational context, not only helping the teaching of disciplines, but also making possible the development of several abilities, such as teamwork, problem-solving, and creativity. Among various robotics kits, LEGO® Robotics has been shown one of the best results considering some evaluated criteria (modularity level, hardware, curriculum, price, etc.). Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO® Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO® Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out a systematic review of the literature. Our main findings are: a) the most widely used environment and programming language are LabVIEW along with the LEGO®'s block-based programming language, b) we identified LEGO® Robotics is used for teaching programming, interdisciplinary contents, participation in tournaments, robotics, and computational thinking, c) LEGO® Robotics is used with success by students of different levels, such as K12, undergraduate, and graduated. Finally, we discuss some problems and limitations related to ER and point out that there is no standardization of teaching practices or methodologies for evaluating results, indicating that more research is needed to find the best scenario regarding technologies, methods, and target audience. © 2018 IEEE.}},

Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Currently, innovation and motivation of students during the learning process are promoted by educational robotics tools. Robots are increasingly integrated into our society. To such an extent that robots are becoming more and more common in our everyday environment. This paper presents a workshop which is focused on two main objectives. The first one is to celebrate Scratch Day promoting Scratch locally. On the other hand, this event is aimed to present a robotic educational tool for people as the first step to get into robotics world. This workshop is aimed on those adults who want to discover what possibilities Scratch brings in the introduction to robotics. Throughout this workshop an initiation to Scratch is developed in the context of educational robotics. As the most significant results throughout the workshop, it is clearly demonstrated that Scratch is an ideal tool for children and adults with no previous programming or robotic experience to begin learning both through hands-on experiences.

In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs. © 2018 IEEE.}},

Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations. © 2018 Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES).}},

Once the methodological framework was defined, we proceeded to develop a computer tool that provides global support for the implementation of this methodology. The implemented platform has a simple and intuitive design that allows an easy use of it since it is aimed at pre-university students and teachers who necessarily do not have advanced knowledge of Computer Science. Finally, the platform automatically provides progress reports and course development, including statistical data by age or gender, among others. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In contrast to the field of computer-supported or computer-Assisted language learning (CALL), which has been investigated intensively for the last decades since the beginning of e-learning and technology-enhanced learning, computational thinking and computer science concepts are not quite common in the context of language lessons. Computational thinking is a problem solving process that, at first sight, has not much to do with language learning. However, as demanded by Jeannette Wing in 2006, it should be taught to everyone like reading, writing and mathematics. By introducing computational thinking in language lessons e.g.Through modeling we could 'kill two birds with one stone': On the one hand, we can teach computational thinking and basics of computer science at all school levels even if there is no related subject, e.g. in primary schools. On the other hand, computational thinking tools like modeling can support language learning in different ways and help to train text comprehension, to acquire and elaborate vocabulary or to visualize grammar rules etc. This paper describes some creative possibilities of introducing computational thinking through modeling in language lessons in primary and secondary education. Besides best practices, it further presents some experiences and results gained from teacher observation, interviews and informal feedback from students and teachers. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In the context of Computer Science (CS) education, one of the most important goals is the development of computational thinking (CT) and problem solving skills. Computational thinking skills are closely related to the CS concepts and approaches. These skills cover fundamental programming concepts such as task decomposition, abstractions and generalization, data structures and algorithms. On the other hand, CS education challenges, promote the search for new educational tools, methods, activities and resources. Consequently, CS education should be extended by adding the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) paradigm principles. The aim of this paper is to show how STEM-driven CS education supports and ensures the development of computational thinking at the high school. We present the already published STEM-driven CS education approach aiming at extending it by introducing a model to assess student achievements, according to the revised Bloom's taxonomy in the connection with CT skills. As a practical implementation, we describe a curriculum of Programming Basics at the high school with respect to STEM-driven aspects and CT skills. We introduce two case studies implemented in the real educational environment. They provide the evidence of availability of our approach. © 2018 IEEE.}},

Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results. © 2003-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {As countries adopt computing education for all pupils from primary school upwards, there are challenging indicators: significant proportions of students who choose to study computing at universities fail the introductory courses, and the evidence for links between formal education outcomes and success in CS is limited. Yet, as we know, some students succeed without prior computing experience. Why is this? Some argue for an innate ability, some for motivation, some for the discrepancies between the expectations of instructors and students, and some - simply - for howprogramming is being taught. All agree that becoming proficient in computing is not easy. Our research takes a novel view on the problem and argues that some of that success is influenced by early childhood experiences outside formal education. The analysis indicates that computing proficiency should be seen from multiple viewpoints, including both skill-level and confidence. Our analysis is the first to show, we believe, that particular early childhood experiences are linked to parts of computing proficiency, namely those related to confidence with problem solving using computing technology. These are essential building blocks for more complex use. We recognize issues in the experimental design that may prevent our data showing a link between early activities and more complex computing skills, and suggest adjustments for future studies. Ultimately, we expect that this line of research will feed in to early years and primary education, and thereby improve computing education for all. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

The proposed learning aims to help students experience what science is and how it is technically utilized. In addition, discipline-specific representations were emphasized in the learning design to help students translate between those in different disciplinary and build up their meta-representational competence, central to engineering professional practice as well as learning about engineering design process in school. During the integrative learning, students were also expected to experience the shift of coding from studying how to write a program code to how to control a device to solve a problem, the computational thinking. The proposed learning practice was held and evaluated with 85 participants from high schools and universities. The results showed that students were motivated, and valued the proposed learning practice. Students perceived the usefulness and ease of use of the tools adopted in the learning practice. The study results suggest that the use of smartphones in education may support the orchestrating of the teaching and learning of science and engineering. © The Author(s) 2018.}},

To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing.

  abstract = {This study sheds light on a holistic understanding of muqarnas with its historical, philosophical and conceptual backgrounds on one hand and formal, structural and algorithmic principles on the other hand. The vault-like Islamic architectural element, muqarnas, is generally considered to be a non-structural decorative element. Various compositional approaches have been proposed to reveal the inner logic of these complex geometric elements. Each of these approaches uses different techniques such as measuring, unit-based decoding or three-dimensional interpretation of two-dimensional patterns. However, the reflections of the inner logic onto different contexts, such as the usage of different initial geometries, materials or performative concerns, were neglected. In this study, we offer a new schema to approach the performative aspects of muqarnas tectonics. This schema contains new sets of elements, properties and relations deriving partly from previous approaches and partly from the technique of folding. Thus, this study first reviews the previous approaches to analyse the geometric and constructional principles of muqarnas. Second, it explains the proposed scheme through a series of algorithmic form-finding experiments. In these experiments, we question whether ‘fold’, as one of the performative techniques of making three-dimensional forms, contributes to the analysis of muqarnas in both a conceptual and computational sense. We argue that encoding vault-like systems via geometric and algorithmic relations based on the logic of the ‘fold’ provides informative and intuitive feedback for form-finding, specifically in the earlier phases of design. While focusing on the performative potential of a specific fold operation, we introduced the concept of bifurcation to describe the generative characteristics of folding technique and the way of subdividing the form with respect to redistribution of the forces. Thus, in this decoding process, the bifurcated fold explains not only to demystify the formal logic of muqarnas but also to generate new forms without losing contextual conditions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.}},

We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java.

Because of its importance in understanding natural language semantics, it becomes one of the most challenging issues within this field. In this paper, we present an enhanced knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that manipulates by calculating the semantic similarity between definitions of the target word and an extended syntactic context vector. The actual meaning of the target word is identified as that for which the semantic similarity between definition and extended syntactic context vector is highest. Therefore, while traditional WSD approaches are based on semantic information, our method is built on both semantic and syntactic relations between sentences. This allows it to take advantage of a better use of comprehensive knowledge and more in line with the human being way of thinking. For the sake of improving the performance of WSD, we combine the syntactic importance of the words within the original document piece to provide a sequence that can be used to decide which words should be disambiguated. Finally, the evaluation performed on two standard datasets shows that our algorithm goes better beyond the baselines and has more desirable features than other popular algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Several instruments have been used for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities. In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT. © 2017 IEEE.}},

As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course. © 2017 IEEE.}},

This includes practical programming skills as well as more conceptual thinking tools developed in the discipline of computer science, sometimes denoted Computational Thinking (CT). The connection between CT and doing programming is sometimes thought of as the connection between theory and practice. The pragmatic thinker Dewey embraced practice in learning and argued that learning and knowing always come from experiencing the world. According to this view, there are no epistemological differences between theory and practice. In computer programming the student's active learning in the form of physical motor movement is important. Using the pragmatic way of analyzing learning to program puts a focus on the situated thinking during the practical programming, which relates to theories about CT. This research is focusing on the practical hands-on part of novice programming and in this aims at getting insights about factors important when learning to program that could inform teachers in the Computer Science classroom. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).}},

  abstract = {The celebrated sparse representation model has led to remarkable results in various signal processing tasks in the last decade. However, despite its initial purpose of serving as a global prior for entire signals, it has been commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a concatenation of banded circulant matrices. While several works have presented algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very few truly-effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In this paper, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal and noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as the ℓ0 norm, mutual coherence, Spark and restricted isometry property to their counterparts in the convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local treatment. © 1991-2012 IEEE.}},

The planning tool presented in this paper was used to engage elementary students in an activity to design and then create a video game using an agent-based programming environment. The design of the planning tool was informed by prior research and literature on concept development. The tool scaffolded the design process by having students (1) describe their game, (2) identify agents, (3) describe agent behavior, and (4) use those descriptions to identify useful algorithms. The set of algorithms used were called computational thinking patterns (CTPs), and sample code was provided for each CTP to assist the programming process. From the information provided by the student a summary was created to show needed agents and helpful programming code. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {We present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python. © 2017 IEEE.}},

We investigated the Italian primary school teachers' conceptions about computational thinking by analyzing the results of a survey (N=972) conducted in the context of "Programma il Futuro" project. Teachers have been asked to provide a definition of computational thinking and to answer three additional related closed-ended questions. The analysis shows that, while almost half of teachers (43.4%) have included in their definitions some fundamental elements of computational thinking, very few (10.8%) have been able to provide an acceptably complete definition. On a more positive note, the majority is aware that computational thinking is not characterized by coding or by the use of information technology. © 2017 ACM.}},

Most previous conclusions on the perception of virtual characters and the effect of character assignment in interactive applications have been reached through short, one-task experiments. To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks. In VEnvI, students create performances for virtual characters by assembling blocks. With a between-subjects design, in which some of the students can alter their character and others are not given that possibility, we examine the influence of the presence or absence of character choice options on learning. We hypothesize that students have higher learning outcomes when they can choose and customize how their character looks compared to when they are assigned a character. We confirm this hypothesis for a category of learning (Remember and Understand) and give insights on students' relationships with their character. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

Such intelligent transportation systems aim to provide novel services that can enable transportation consumers and managers to be better informed and make safer and more efficient use of the infrastructure. However, the transportation domain is characterized by both complex data and complex problems, which calls for visual analytics approaches. The science of visual analytics is continuing to develop principles, methods, and tools to enable synergistic work between humans and computers through interactive visual interfaces. Such interfaces support the unique capabilities of humans (such as the flexible application of prior knowledge and experiences, creative thinking, and insight) and couple these abilities with machines' computational strengths, enabling the generation of new knowledge from large and complex data. In this paper, we describe recent developments in visual analytics that are related to the study of movement and transportation systems and discuss how visual analytics can enable and improve the intelligent transportation systems of the future. We provide a survey of literature from the visual analytics domain and organize the survey with respect to the different types of transportation data, movement and its relationship to infrastructure and behavior, and modeling and planning.

  abstract = {As K-12 computer science (CS) initiatives scale throughout the U.S., educators face increasing pressure from their school systems to provide evidence about student learning on hard-Tomeasure CS outcomes. At the same time, researchers studying curriculum implementation and student learning want reliable measures of how students apply their CS knowledge. This paper describes a two-year validation study focused on end-of-unit and cumulative assessments for Exploring Computer Science, an introductory high school CS curriculum. To develop the assessments, we applied a principled methodology called Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) to (1) work with various stakeholders to identify the important computer science skills to measure, (2) map those skills to a model of evidence that can support inferences about those skills, and (3) develop assessment tasks that elicit that evidence. Using ECD, we created assessments that measure the practices of computational thinking, in contrast to assessments that only measure CS conceptual knowledge. We iteratively developed and piloted the assessments with 941 students over two years and collected three types of validity evidence based on contemporary psychometric standards: Test content, internal structure, and student response processes. Results show that reliability was moderate to high for each of the unit assessments; the assessment tasks within each assessment are well aligned with each other and with the targeted learning goals; and average scores were in the 60 to 70 percent range. These results indicate that the assessments validly measure students' computational thinking practices covered in the introductory CS curriculum. We discuss the broader issues we faced of balancing the need to use the assessment results for evaluation and research, and demands from teachers for use in the classroom. © 2017 ACM.}},

In this paper, CT is represented through the graphical programming language Scratch according to the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick [1]. This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS. Finally, we present several working examples based on the works of Open Source Physics at Singapore. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Drawing on the long debate about whether computer science (CS) and computational thinking skills are innate or learnable, this working group is based on the following hypothesis: The apparent innate ability of some CS learners who succeed in CS courses despite no prior exposure to computing is a manifestation of early childhood experiences and learning outside formal education. The key elements here are early experiences which are outside formal education that may be leading to success in CS courses, as these aspects have not been previously studied in detail. Example experiences and learning are the kinds of toys played with, the encouragement given to explore, particular hobbies, exposure to different kinds of languages, and so on. An informal exercise with 16 CS academics elicited the following potential pre-requisites from their own childhood experiences: • Modelling, particularly when designing from scratch • Autonomous devices from paper planes to steam engines • Exposure to ad-hoc household fixing / repair processes • Toys with discrete, not continuous, elements, e.g. Lego bricks, not smooth wooden blocks • Interest in notations - music, languages (bi-lingual parents) • Parental attitudes encouraging open exploration, with minimal limits and permission to fail • Following instructions: knitting, cooking, origami, Lego • Making games - a set of rules Consideration of the hypothesis leads to the following research questions: 1. Can we find activities that are relatively more common to the childhood experiences of those with CS skills, e.g. successful CS students, academics and professionals, by comparison with other members of the population? 2. If such activities can be determined, what common understanding, skills or attitudes can be derived from them? 3. Can the common aspects of the activities be linked to CS skills and therefore seen as pre-requisites? 4. In what ways are these common aspects already present in formal early years or primary education, and where they are not, how could they be incorporated effectively? Studies supporting this hypothesis would be beneficial as follows: • Provide further evidence against the innate view of CS skills, encouraging study of CS specific pedagogy. • Inform educational practices and research in the early years, a field recognised as being of increasing importance. • Enable early years and primary teachers with no formal CS background to focus on educational activities with which they are familiar and confident while still developing essential foundations for CT skills. The primary focus of this working group is the first research question above. If this is answered positively, then we will work on preliminary answers to the subsequent questions. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).}},

Relying on the concept of articulation developed in cultural studies, the article asks what, exactly, is meant by the computational in the context of journalism? Drawing on interviews with key managerial staff, editors and developers at Scandinavian news organizations, three broad claims about the linkage between the computational and journalism emerged. These articulations include the notion that machines don’t have instincts, that democracy can never be personalized and finally that the computational is something to think with, rather than simulate. The argument is made that what can and cannot be calculated is not merely a technical question, it is also a deeply social, cultural, political and economic one. Thus, the computational emerges as an important organising framework and discursive order for thinking and talking about journalism in the digital age. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.}},

Once an anathema to parents and teachers, digital games are increasingly at the forefront of conversations about ways to address student engagement and provoke challenges to media pedagogies. While advances in game-based learning are already transforming educative practices globally, with tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google taking notice and investing in educational game initiatives, there is a concurrent and critically important development that focuses on “game construction” pedagogy as a vehicle for bringing computational literacy to middle and high school students. Founded on Seymour Papert’s constructionist learning model and developed over nearly two decades, there is compelling evidence that game construction can increase confidence and build capacity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This project is a research-based challenge to the by now widely questioned but surprisingly persistent presumption that students in today's classrooms are all by default “digitally native” and that those “digitally native” children are learning just by playing digital games. Through a survey of 60+ students at a largely immigrant middle school in Toronto, Canada, we present some important updates on youth’s media and technology competence and its relationship to baseline knowledge of computer programming and performance in a computational literacy game-based curriculum. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.}},

  abstract = {In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Currently, there is a "boom" in introductory programming courses to help students develop their computational thinking skills. Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: A) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices; b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors; and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-Aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. These snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. Submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. We leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. Also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. We have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. Our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings. © 2017 IEEE.}},

When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools.

  abstract = {Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, 'moderately ill-structured problems' are defined as a category of problems specified by 'well-structured domain model' and 'ill-structured problem setting'. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as 'problem-posing assignment' based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback. © 2017 IEEE.}},

We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.}},

As new consoles, PC, and mobile devices penetrate more foreign markets, revenues derived from these devices and software will continue to increase. In a nationally representative sample of U.S. teens, 99% of boys and 94% of girls played video games. Over 45% of women play video games and 30% of people over the age of 50 play games on a regular basis. Overall, 72% of Americans play video games in the U.S. and the amount of time spent playing games continues to increase, as do foreign markets. The increased market capitalization of the industry increases demand of qualified applicants. Other industries leveraging similar technology are beginning to grow and have topped over $10 billion in revenue in 2014. Students with expertise in game and related technology will have an advantage in these new job opportunities. Christian Brothers University (CBU) seeks to fill this need by the creation of a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Management (BSEM - Information Management) in Video Game Design. This degree will give students the skills needed to pursue a career within the game industry and others while developing engineering skills. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking and coding is gradually becoming an important part of K-12 education. Most parents, policy makers, teachers, and industrial stakeholders want their children to attain computational thinking and coding competences, since learning how to code is emerging as an important skill for the 21st century. Currently, educators are leveraging a variety of technological tools and programming environments, which can provide challenging and dynamic coding experiences. Despite the growing research on the design of coding experiences for children, it is still difficult to say how children of different ages learn to code, and to cite differences in their task-based behaviour. This study uses eye-tracking data from 44 children (here divided into "kids" [age 8-12] and "teens" [age 13-17]) to understand the learning process of coding in a deeper way, and the role of gaze in the learning gain and the different age groups. The results show that kids are more interested in the appearance of the characters, while teens exhibit more hypothesis-testing behaviour in relation to the code. In terms of collaboration, teens spent more time overall performing the task than did kids (higher similarity gaze). Our results suggest that eye-tracking data can successfully reveal how children of different ages learn to code. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).}},

Tools such as Scratch, Alice, and Kodu have been developed to engage students in learning to program through the creation of computational artifacts (e.g., games, animations, and stories). However, less is known about how elementary and middle school children reason about program behavior. Such skills are useful for reading and adapting others programs, locating possible sources of bugs, and predicting program behavior given code snippets (i.e., mental-simulation). The goal of this poster is to measure and track the development of students' ability to reason about programs using Teague & Lister's Neo-Piagetian classification of novice programmers: Sensorimotor, Preoperational Thinkers, and Concrete Operational Thinkers. We operationalize Teague and Lister's category descriptions by creating a criterion for each category. This classification has helped us characterize students' mastery of strategies for reasoning about the lawful behavior of programs using a Kodu curriculum. In particular, this categorization was used to differentiate students' reasoning styles using data from two studies having 20 and 19 students each. We found strong consistency in the results across both studies. Through analysis and categorization of student responses, most students fall into the preoperational thinker category. Within this category, we found a diversity of mastery patterns that help us understand where students face challenges in reasoning about programs. © 2017 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computer programming is being introduced in schools worldwide as part of a movement that promotes Computational Thinking (CT) skills among young learners. In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners-even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning-still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations. © 2017 IEEE.}},

The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries.

The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials. The level of comprehension amongst the middle schoolers was evident through their ability to produce the final products, which ultimately varied depending upon the method of teaching that the high schooler chose to teach with.

  abstract = {With the rise of big data and computational power, one could be forgiven for thinking that it is just a matter of time before most complex systems, whether physical or socioeconomical, are understood, modeled, and eventually predicted with great precision. Alongside the growing volumes of information collected about human behavior through transactions, communications, and web searches, the Internet of Things promises to supply digital information to help us monitor machines and improve our everyday interactions with new devices. The temptation to construct evermore complex models is widespread, driven by the appearance of increased sophistication and the hope of improving predictability. The philosophical principle known as Occam's razor, however, warns against complexity and favors parsimonious models. When attempting to quantify risk, this guiding principle is as relevant today as it was when introduced in the 14th century. Transparency and ease of use are also important characteristics of models that will appeal to practitioners. Rather than seeking the holy grail of the illusive single optimal model, an ensemble of diverse parsimonious models may offer the best chance of accurately quantifying risk. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A series of computational experiments were conducted on the ATS by using a school bus system as a case study to validate the feasibility and superiority of our method. Several computational experiments were conducted to predict the traffic distribution in normal and abnormal traffic scenarios and to analyze the extent to which each factor influences the travel modal split.

  abstract = {Embedded computing is often considered as a hidden technology where learners can require more assistance to inspect processes and activities hidden within the technologies, making use of debugging, monitoring, and visual tools. To the student, this kind of technology often has abstract behaviours where the only information/things people can see is the final action, and they do not know how the internal processes work and communicate inside the embedded computing device to achieve the desired result. Augmented reality (AR) can overcome this issue and produce a magic-lens view for revealing hidden embedded computing activities. This can result in learners achieving a better level of knowledge and awareness of the technology, as well as higher learning outcomes. AR on its own will not improve the learning processes without first considering how to manage and represent the hidden information. Therefore, a pedagogical virtual machine (PVM) model was employed, and to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the proposed model. We conducted an experiment based on a problem-solving educational mobile robot task. Twenty students participated in the experimental (AR approach) and control (conventional approach) group. The result showed that the augmented reality approach was more effective in increasing students' computational thinking and learning outcomes. In addition, the augmented reality approach reduced both time completion and debugging times. © 2017 ACM.}},

However, despite the synergies between CT and STEM education, integrating the two to support synergistic learning remains an important challenge. Relatively, little is known about how a student’s conceptual understanding develops in such learning environments and the difficulties they face when learning with such integrated curricula. In this paper, we present a research study with CTSiM (Computational Thinking in Simulation and Modeling)—computational thinking-based learning environment for K-12 science, where students build and simulate computational models to study and gain an understanding of science processes. We investigate a set of core challenges (both computational and science domain related) that middle school students face when working with CTSiM, how these challenges evolve across different modeling activities, and the kinds of support provided by human observers that help students overcome these challenges. We identify four broad categories and 14 subcategories of challenges and show that the human-provided scaffolds help reduce the number of challenges students face over time. Finally, we discuss our plans to modify the CTSiM interfaces and embed scaffolding tools into CTSiM to help students overcome their various programming, modeling, and science-related challenges and thus gain a deeper understanding of the science concepts. © 2016, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet. © 2016 IEEE.}},

Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers.

  abstract = {Background: Robotics competitions are increasingly popular and potentially provide an on-ramp to computer science, which is currently highly gender imbalanced. However, within competitive robotics teams, student participation in programming is not universal. This study gathered surveys from over 500 elementary, middle, and high school robotics competition participants to examine (1) whether programming involvement in these competitions is associated with motivation to pursue additional programming experiences and (2) whether opportunities to learn programming varied by gender, age, and competition type. Results: Results showed a significant association of students’ programming involvement with their motivation to learn more programming. Interestingly, in the youngest groups/entry-level competitions, girls were heavily involved in programming. Unfortunately, in older/more advanced competitions, girls were generally less involved in programming, even after controlling for prior programming experience. These gendered effects were substantially explained by programming interest. Conclusions: While robotics competition experiences may motivate students to learn more programming, gender gaps in programming involvement persist in these learning environments and appear to widen as students grow older and enter more advanced competitions. Therefore, addressing gender imbalances in programming will likely require greater attention to particular curricular and pedagogical characteristics of robotics competitions that support girls’ interest and involvement in programming. © 2016, The Author(s).}},

These teaching modules include a lecture module, an online test module and a CFD project module. The lecture module introduces the importance of critical thinking skills by an example case, critical thinking definition and processes, and the application of critical thinking skills in formulation of CFD problems. In the online test module, seven online tests have been developed to enhance the students' understanding of the contents of lectures and practical sessions. Meanwhile, students apply their critical thinking skills to work out some of the tests. In the project module, a student-driven CFD project is designed to help students to apply CFD techniques and critical thinking skills in engineering problems. In the project, students choose their own project topic and problems. They use CFD skills learned in the course and critical thinking skills to critically analyse their problems, identify the important parameters and review results. They apply the critical writing skills to finalise a project report. To the best knowledge of the author, this systematical integration of teaching and enhancement of critical thinking skills in computational fluid dynamics course is innovative. Feedback from students is quite positive shown by an anonymous survey in 2014. © SAGE Publications.}},

Examining survey data from 2003 revealed a positive correlation of earnings against these variables, even after controlling for the occupations of workers. Overall, occupation-adjusted earnings were 14% higher for workers who used spreadsheets/databases and who also did programming, versus those who did neither. These results provoke numerous questions for future research regarding what financial benefits workers can expect to obtain in different settings through end-user programming. © 2016 IEEE.}},

The advantage of this approach is that solutions can be generated through algorithms that can be implemented as computer code. Although computational thinking has historically been a skill that is exclusively taught within computer science, there has been a more recent movement to introduce these skills within other disciplines. Psychology is an excellent example of a discipline that would benefit from computational thinking skills because of the nature of questions that are typically asked within the discipline. However, there has not been a formal curriculum proposed to teach computational thinking within psychology and the behavioural sciences. I will argue that computational thinking is a fundamental skill that can easily be introduced to psychology students throughout their undergraduate education.

  abstract = {In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system, is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high computational ability. © 2016 IEEE.}},

These changes include a competency-based education curriculum in which students' IT knowledge and skills can be assessed in a way that three college course credits can be awarded to students who are still in high schools, a 12-hour graduate certificate program that prepares both in-and pre-service teachers to teach college IT courses for University of Cincinnati at their high schools through an Ohio College Credit Plus program, and a more concentrated research in computational thinking, which has been brought up for national attention and recognized as one of the essential competencies among Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics disciplines. © 2016 IEEE.}},

The need for maintaining continuous connections that deliver data with high reliability necessitate re-thinking of conventional design of the transport layer protocol. This paper investigates the use of Q-learning in TCP cwnd adaptation during the congestion avoidance state, wherein the classical alternation of the window is replaced, thereby allowing the protocol to immediately respond to previously seen network conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how memory plays a critical role in building the exploration space, and proposes ways to reduce this overhead through function approximation. The superior performance of the learning-based approach over TCP New Reno is demonstrated through a comprehensive simulation study, revealing 33.8% and 12.1% improvement in throughput and delay, respectively, for the evaluated topologies. We also show how function approximation can be used to dramatically reduce the memory requirements of a learning-based protocol while maintaining the same throughput and delay. © 2016 IEEE.}},

The simple use of technological apparatuses in the classroom does not guarantee the improvement of the learning process, however it can be the medium through which the students find the alternatives for the solution of complex problems. The Computational Thinking is an approach of teaching that uses a diverse range of techniques derived from computers for the resolution of these problems combined with the new competencies of the 21st century (critical thinking, collaboration, etc.). The adoption of the notion of Computing within the basic education schools is a concern in many countries, where the implementation occurs in a strict way. Admittedly, it grows the idea that the Computing discipline is very distinct from the computer classes and that the use of skills from Computing possesses educational (reflection and problem solving, the comprehension that the world is ingrained with the digital technology) and economic (high demand of professionals with good training) benefits.

The majority of the students were people with physical, cognitive or intellectual disabilities and they were able to follow, enjoy and learn as any other student making this an accessible activity to everyone.

While research has focused on the reduction achieved, the effectiveness of these strategies in selecting representative mutants, and the limits in doing so have not been investigated, either theoretically or empirically. We investigate the practical limits to the effectiveness of mutation reduction strategies, and provide a simple theoretical framework for thinking about the absolute limits. Our results show that the limit in improvement of effectiveness over random sampling for real-world open source programs is a mean of only 13.078%. Interestingly, there is no limit to the improvement that can be made by addition of new mutation operators. Given that this is the maximum that can be achieved with perfect advance knowledge of mutation kills, what can be practically achieved may be much worse. We conclude that more effort should be focused on enhancing mutations than removing operators in the name of selective mutation for questionable benefit. © 2016 ACM.}},

  abstract = {The outcome of a multidisciplinary and iterative process, CyberPLAYce is a tangible, interactive, cyber-physical learning tool for children supporting computational thinking and, particularly, playful storytelling. CyberPLAYce finds inspiration in the concept of child-computer interaction, where meaning is constructed through spatially reconfiguring the physical environment. The novel aspect of CyberPLAYce is its extension of cyber-learning to the dimension of space where children construct meaning at a larger physical scale. This paper outlines the motivations for CyberPLAYce, focuses on the full arc of design and evaluation activities concerning computational thinking (CT) practices that engaged 8-12-year-old storytellers, and concludes with a consideration of future work focusing on spatial thinking with CyberPLAYce. Results from our empirical study suggest that cyber-physical play afforded by CyberPLAYce scaffolds computational thinking, creating, and sharing in children. Particularly for IDC researchers in the educational domain, CyberPLAYce represents a Researchthrough-design exemplar supporting children's enjoyment of learning and meaning-construction. © 2016 ACM.}},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a multi-semester study of the impact on student perceptions of their computational thinking abilities as a result of collaboration between students in computer science (CS) and journalism courses to solve a problem for a community partner, Habitat for Humanity. Interdisciplinary computing collaborations have become a popular mode of instruction in upper-level CS courses. In many cases, these collaborations have been with other STEM disciplines. However, there are non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science and can also serve as fruitful test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need. The study investigates whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. 41 CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in a range of other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking. Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers. It is particularly noteworthy that CS majors' gains outpaced those of computer engineering majors. Further research is planned to gain additional insight into the possible reasons behind these results. © 2016 ACM.}},

The success of promoting coding education or integrating it into school curriculum depends on the perceptions of teachers and headmasters in schools, and how well they believe on coding education and prepare for the innovative teaching and learning. In this exploratory research study, it reports the results of a large-scale quantitative questionnaire surveying 42 primary and secondary schools (n = 42) in Hong Kong, where computer programming has not been regulated as a compulsory course in K-12 curriculum. The questionnaire aims to investigate the school belief on coding education and their practical challenges while integrating it into their regular school curriculum. Our results show that there is a trend in the local schools promoting coding education with positive perceptions on teaching and learning. However, teaching challenges are also mentioned in the survey waiting for solutions, such as lack of teachers training and unified curriculum. Therefore, the empirical experiences of these schools have set forth the future research direction in design and implementation of coding education in K-12 classrooms not only in Hong Kong but also in the globe. © 2015 IEEE.}},

It is a cognitive model going beyond rational-actor methods. Having such a model has proven useful when information is uncertain, fragmentary, indirect, soft, conflicting, and even deceptive. Inferences from fusion must then account for uncertainties about the model, the credibility of information, and the fusion methods-i.e. We must consider both structural and parametric uncertainties, including uncertainties about the uncertainties. We use a novel combination of (1) probabilistic and parametric methods, (2) alternative models and model structures, and (3) alternative fusion methods that include nonlinear algebraic combination, variants of Bayesian inference, and a new entropy-maximizing approach. Initial results are encouraging and suggest that such an analytically flexible and model-based approach to fusion can simultaneously enrich thinking, enhance threat detection, and reduce harmful false alarms. © 2015 IEEE.}},

Yet, the exposure of K-12 students to CT in many schools is practically non-existent. For students to acquire this important skill, teachers require in-depth knowledge of the problem solving strategies that define CT and strategies for integrating CT into their lesson plans. The proposed special session will be both a tutorial on CT and an interactive session for sharing the experience and results from a CT workshop held at Columbus State University for middle and high school STEM subject teachers. This workshop, offered as a part of the ACT4STEM (Applying Computational Thinking for STEM Disciplines) project took place in the summer of 2015. It brought together teachers from the metropolitan Columbus area in Georgia with priority given to teachers from high-need schools (as determined by the GA Department of Education [1]). The workshop introduced the participants to CT concepts and demonstrated how CT strategies of pattern recognition, generalization, problem decomposition and algorithmic thinking can be used to improve student learning of STEM concepts. The proposed special session will present sample CT modules and projects and lesson plans designed by participants during the workshop. It will include interactive, hands-on activities and discussions in addition to results from the teachers' actual experiences on applying these lesson plans in their classes. This special session will benefit K12 teachers of STEM subjects interested in improving their students' comprehension of discipline related concepts and their application. Moreover computer science faculty interested in helping K-12 teachers by organizing training sessions will gain valuable insights from the first-hand accounts of the presenters of their own experience with such an effort. © 2016 ACM.}},

  abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in broadening participation in computer science is teacher preparation as few middle and high school teachers have a formal background in computing. Further, without a credentialing program, there are limited ways to learn content and pedagogical strategies for effective computer science instruction. As a result, professional development is key to successful reform in the teaching of computer science. In this paper we describe our three-pronged approach to the design of a professional development model for middle and high school teachers interested in implementing the Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum in their classrooms or infusing CSP modules into STEM curricula. We describe our model focusing on content, pedagogical strategies and follow-up classroom support during the academic year. We subsequently report on participating teacher outcomes, in terms of self-rated understandings, attitudes and implementation practices.

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and initial implementation of a new CS0 course for CS majors at Ohio University and an associated computer science placement exam. It was our expectation that this course would help improve overall retention and academic performance of CS majors. The new CS0 course was intended for new students with little or no programming experience. Hence, we designed CS0 by selecting some of the best components of other CS0 efforts from the literature, namely, introductory programming in Python, computational thinking, and motivational material aimed at instilling ownership of the major. In order to direct students into CS0 or CS1 appropriately, a placement exam was given to students during orientation. The placement process resulted in a mixed cohort consisting of students with no programming experience as well as other students with programming experience who did not pass the placement exam. Longitudinal analysis of student grades in CS0 and CS1 showed that these were two distinct populations with very different needs. A statistically significant difference was found in the CS1 grades for CS0 students from these populations. Surprisingly, CS0 students without prior programming experience got significantly higher grades in CS1 than CS0 students who had programmed before. We share lessons learned from our experience, including a revised placement process to address these separate populations. © 2016 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Plagiarism is known as an unauthorized use of other's contents in writing and ideas in thinking without proper acknowledgment. There are several tools implemented for text-based plagiarism detection using various methods and techniques. However, these tools become inefficient while handling a large number of datasets due to the process of plagiarism detection which comprises of a lot of computational tasks and large memory requirement. Therefore, when we deal with a large number of datasets, there should be a way to accelerate the process by applying acceleration techniques to optimize the plagiarism detection. In response to this, we have developed a parallel algorithm using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and tested it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. An equivalent algorithm is run on CPU platform as well. From the comparison of the results, CPU shows better performance when the number and the size of the documents are small. Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU. Thus, introducing GPU based optimization algorithm to the plagiarism detection gives a real solution while handling a large number of data for inter-document plagiarism detection. © 2015 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Neuroscience in the 21st Century: From Basic to Clinical, Second Edition}},
  abstract = {Philosophers, psychologists, and biologists have long pondered how experiences mark the mind. It is clear that there is no one seat of memory. Within each memory system there are multiple biological mechanisms for information storage. This chapter focuses on how memory could be supported by coincidence of neural activity, changes in synaptic strength, and synchronization of networks. Another major theme in memory research is the localization and specialization of function by different memory systems which can be revealed through appropriate behavioral tests. Recent technological advances allow for powerful new ways to record and perturb neural circuits to test the veracity of long-held theories about the relationship between biology and cognition. The fundamental challenge for a memory system is to recognize past experiences that have utility in guiding action. This is difficult because no two situations are identical, and therefore it is necessary for the brain to match which events and stimuli should be grouped together due to common meaning. This is the computation that occurs upon meeting someone new and thinking, “You remind me of an old friend." From this flash of familiarity, recollections of past experiences shape the interaction with the stranger and, in doing so, bias how this new person is seen and which aspects of the experience become committed to memory. This everyday example illustrates the profound influence memory has on learning, behavior, and even perception. There are several ways to seek an explanation for how the brain uses the past to bias future behavior. One is to design experiments that decrease the probability of an event’s occurrence, such as removing a part of the brain and observing memory loss. These loss-of-function experiments elucidate the necessity of a specific phenomenon for the occurrence of another. Other experiments are designed to cause something to happen, such as the delivery of a drug that enhances memory performance. These experiments inform us as to the sufficiency that the presence of one event is enough to observe another. Gain of function and loss of function experiments may perturb the system in unexpected ways, and therefore it is also important to observe the brain with minimal intervention. In such observations, experimenters seek to identify variables that covary, such as the activity of a neuron correlating with some stimulus. A final and important method for understanding the link between biology and cognition is computational and mathematical modeling of neural systems (Hopfield 1995; Marr 1971). These more abstract analyses can offer predictions that, if validated, lead credence to the model from which the prediction was derived, which may provide insight into processes beyond the current limit of experimental validation. Furthermore, there may be many biologic solutions to the same computational problem and modeling efforts help to identify necessary and sufficient overarching principles that unite seemingly disparate observations. The convergence of these lines of evidence - necessity, sufficiency, correlation, and modeling - has shown that there are multiple memory systems that specialize in storing and processing different kinds of information. In each of these systems, information is thought to be stored in changes in communication efficacy between neurons. The temporal organization of neural activity required for such changes in synaptic strength and for efficient communication is achieved by coordination of brain rhythms across brain regions. This chapter will handle these broad topics with an emphasis on the technological advances in behavioral testing, genetics, imaging, and recording that allowed each new scientific advance. Very few contemporary concepts in memory research are brand new, and therefore it is essential to first discuss the insights of the pioneers that have shaped the current understanding of the neurobiology of memory © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013 and Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill for students, and assessment is a critical factor in education. However, there is a lack of effective approaches to CT assessment. Therefore, we designed the Three-Dimensional Integrated Assessment (TDIA) framework in this article. The TDIA has two aims: one was to integrate three dimensions (directionality, openness, and process) into the design of effective assessment tasks; and the other was to assess comprehensively the three dimensions of CT including computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Guided by the TDIA framework, we designed three pairs of tasks: closed forward tasks and closed reverse tasks, semiopen forward tasks and semiopen reverse tasks, and open tasks with a creative design report and open tasks without a creative design report. To further confirm each task's applicability and its advantages and disadvantages, we conducted a test experiment at the end of the autumn semester in 2014 in a primary school for 3 weeks. The results indicated that (a) the reverse tasks were not more superior than the forward tasks; (b) the semiopen tasks and the open tasks were more effective than the closed tasks, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others; (c) the self-reports provided a helpful function for learning diagnosis and guidance; (d) the scores had no significant difference between the schoolboys and the schoolgirls in all six tasks; and (e) the six tasks' difficulty and discrimination were all acceptable, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others. To effectively apply them, the following suggestions for teachers to design computational tasks are proposed: motivating students' interest and enthusiasm, incorporating semifinished artifacts, involving learning diagnosis and guidance, and including multiple types of tasks in an assessment. © The Author(s) 2015.}},

  abstract = {Introduction to Computing is a public course for the first-year non-major undergraduate students, aiming at training students for the abilities in computer science and technology with computational thinking. However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing. © 2015 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Background: Problem posing, the generation of questions by learners, has been shown to be an effective instructional strategy for teaching–learning of complex materials in domains such as mathematics. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of problem posing in two dimensions. Firstly, we present how problem posing can result in unfolding of knowledge and hence how it can be used as an instructional strategy. Then we present another problem posing-based activity as an assessment tool in an Introductory Programming course (CS1). Method: To explore the potential of problem posing as an instructional strategy, we conducted field studies in the two CS application courses (Data Structures (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)), in which we provided a semi-structured problem posing situation to students. We performed inductive qualitative research and development the questions generated by students using grounded theory-based qualitative data analysis technique. To explore the potential of problem posing as an assessment tool, we conducted a field study in CS1 wherein we employed another problem posing (PP)-based activity in a large class for assessing the learning of computational thinking concepts in an introductory programming course and analysed how performance in traditional assessment tools (quiz score) is related with performance in our non-traditional assessment tool (quality of problems posed during a problem posing activity). Results: From the studies in DS and AI courses we found that students pose questions and unfold knowledge using seven strategies — Apply, Organize, Probe, Compare, Connect, Vary, and Implement. From the field study performed in the CS1 course we found that the quality of the problems posed (difficulty level) were mostly aligned to the traditional assessment results in the case of novice learners but not in the case of advanced learners. © 2015, The Author(s).}},

Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations.

We present an in-depth case study of first-year management engineering students enrolled in a required introductory programming course at a large North American university. Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the programmer's language and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry. © 2015 IEEE.}},

From this we establish the main topics covered, and how they are positioned to be suitable for students from the first year of school to approximately their eighth year. We then report on a pilot study of a curriculum based on Computational Thinking; long term the study will encompass a range of topics and year levels, but the pilot focused on topics suitable for 11 to 12 year old students. Here we detail the design of this part of the curriculum, the manner of its delivery, and the experiences and observations of the generalist teacher who taught the course. Through assessment data, student responses to an attitude survey, and class observations we have evaluated the pilot curriculum.

  abstract = {Computational thinking ability is important in computer science education. It emphasizes abstraction and automation. For automation, programming has become a key ability in digital society recently. As a result, the increase in the importance of coding education in many countries has brought various educational methods to improve teenagers' programming abilities. Among programming abilities, reading ability is important especially to programming novices. This paper focuses on the effects of gender and abstract thinking abilities of adolescents on understanding computer programs. Also, we examine if there is any difference in teaching between adolescents and college students. In order to achieve our research goals, we surveyed on the abstract thinking level, and then measured program understanding ability for 300 academic high school students who had learned C language. From this research, we found that the abstract thinking affects more complex program understanding positively. Also, we found that the language experience before learning brought the difference in program understanding. However, we could not find statistical differences in program understanding between two genders. From this research, we can provide a new point of view to improve adolescents' programming ability with abstract thinking and gender factors. © 2015 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {For all computer scientists the term 'modeling' is well known. It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project 'Informatics - A Child's Play', which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons. © 2015 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Proceedings of the IEEE}},
  abstract = {In this era of large-scale data, distributed systems built on top of clusters of commodity hardware provide cheap and reliable storage and scalable processing of massive data. With cheap storage, instead of storing only currently relevant data, it is common to store as much data as possible, hoping that its value can be extracted later. In this way, exabytes (10 $^{18} $ bytes) of data are being created on a daily basis. Extracting value from these data, however, requires scalable implementations of advanced analytical algorithms beyond simple data processing, e.g., statistical regression methods, linear algebra, and optimization algorithms. Most such traditional methods are designed to minimize floating-point operations, which is the dominant cost of in-memory computation on a single machine. In parallel and distributed environments, however, load balancing and communication, including disk and network input/output (I/O) , can easily dominate computation. These factors greatly increase the complexity of algorithm design and challenge traditional ways of thinking about the design of parallel and distributed algorithms. Here, we review recent work on developing and implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and distributed environments. Randomized algorithms for matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either in theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a single machine. Our main focus is on the underlying theory and practical implementation of random projection and random sampling algorithms for very large very overdetermined (i.e., overconstrained) $\ell-{1}$- and $\ell-{2} $-regression problems. Randomization can be used in one of two related ways: either to construct subsampled problems that can be solved, exactly or approximately, with traditional numerical methods; or to construct preconditioned versions of the original full problem that are easier to solve with traditional iterative algorithms. Theoretical results demonstrate that in near input-sparsity time and with only a few passes through the data one can obtain very strong relative-error approximate solutions, with high probability. Empirical results highlight the importance of various tradeoffs (e.g., between the time to construct an embedding and the conditioning quality of the embedding, between the relative importance of computation versus communication, etc.) and demonstrate that $\ell-{1}$- and $\ell-{2} $-regression problems can be solved to low, medium, or high precision in existing distributed systems on up to terabyte-sized data. © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The 'Bebras' is an international large scale contest that aims to motivate children for engaging in Computer Science. In this paper we present an investigation of the psychometric factors that determine the success in this contest, e.g. Abilities in Computational Thinking or intelligence factors. For this purpose, we looked for subsets of Bebras questions that are requiring joint psychometric constructs, according to the responses of the test persons, applying latent trait analysis on all combinations of questions. After identifying suitable sets of questions, we tested the fit of the mono-parametric Rasch Model and evaluated the distribution of person parameters. Additionally, the identified sets of questions were analyzed by qualitative methods to find out the nature of these common psychometric constructs. As a test bed for feasibility studies, we have chosen the Bebras Contests of Germany 2009. We have found and analyzed several sets of questions that met our requirements, analyzed the questions, and identified differences in the performance of boys and girls in these sets. © 2015 IEEE.}},

Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted. © The Author 2014.}},

  abstract = {In the Western classical tradition, musicians play music from notated sheet music, called a score. When playing music from a score, a musician translates its visual symbols into sequences of instrument-specific physical motions. Hence, a music score's overall complexity represents a sum of the cognitive and mechanical acuity required for its performance. For a given instrument, different notes, intervals, articulations, dynamics, key signatures, and tempo represent dissimilar levels of difficulty, which vary depending on the performer's proficiency. Individual musicians embrace this tenet, but may disagree about the degrees of difficulty. This paper introduces musiplectics (musiplectics = music + plectics, Greek for the study of complexity), a systematic and objective approach to computational assessment of the complexity of a music score for any instrument. Musiplectics defines computing paradigms for automatically and accurately calculating the complexity of playing a music score on a given instrument. The core concept codifies a two-phase process. First, music experts rank the relative difficulty of individual musical components (e.g., notes, intervals, dynamics, etc.) for different playing proficiencies and instruments. Second, a computing engine automatically applies this ranking to music scores and calculates their respective complexity. As a proof of concept of musiplectics, we present an automated, Web-based application called Musical Complexity Scoring (MCS) for music educators and performers. Musiplectics can engender the creation of practical computing tools for objective and expeditious assessment of a music score's suitability for the abilities of intended performers. © 2015 ACM.}},

We present and discuss the conceptualizations that potentially emerge from using these five tools and compare them with established concurrency concepts. Our findings indicate opportunities for an explicit exploration of how some concurrency aspects are implemented in games and simulations built with CT tools.

  author = {Evia C.; Sharp M.R.; Perez-Quinones M.A.}},
  year = {2015}},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication}},
  abstract = {Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of 'layers of abstraction' guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints. © 1988-2012 IEEE.}},

Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus 'i' is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well. © 2015 IEEE.}},

The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success.

The phenomenological context, which is based on observable patterns of object interaction that recur in games and simulations, is particularly valuable for developing the capacity to think abstractly. Abstraction is the key to recognizing analogous conditions, an ability that is the basis for transferring learning to new situations. The disciplinary context describes areas of application within and across subject areas, including computer science, that can foster proficiency with data representation, problem decomposition, and other CT skills. Using the Scalable Game Design curriculum as a lens to examine classroom practices, we find that teachers both plan and enact CT instruction in these contexts.}},

CCE implementation students had significantly higher study time (t(1, 136) = 2.08, p =.04; M=3.88 to M=3.29; 7-point scale) and significantly lower lack of regulation, which measures difficulties with studying (t(1, 136) = 2.82, p =.006; M=2.80 to M=3.21; 5-point scale). The addition of computational creativity exercises to CS courses may improve computational thinking and learning of CS knowledge and skills. © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Measuring word semantic similarity is a generic problem with a broad range of applications such as ontology mapping, computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. Previous approaches to computing word semantic similarity did not consider concept occurrence frequency and word's sense number. This paper introduced Hyponymy graph, and based on which proposed a novel word semantic similarity model. For two words to be compared, we first retrieve their related concepts; then produce lowest common ancestor matrix and distance matrix between concepts; finally calculate distance-based similarity and information-based similarity, which are integrated to get final semantic similarity. The main contribution of our method is that both concept occurrence frequency and word's sense number are taken into account. This similarity measurement more closely fits with human rating and effectively simulates human thinking process. Our experimental results on benchmark dataset M&C and R&G with WordNet2.1 as platform demonstrate roughly 0.9%-1.2% improvements over existing best approaches.}},

The students in two public schools were given a set of Scratch programming challenges. The SOLO taxonomy was used to classify student programming responses based on the degree of understanding of the problem structure. The majority of fourth grade students from one school demonstrated the ability to synchronize the costume and motion of a single character sprite, as well as synchronize a basic conversation between multiple sprites. However, they struggled to integrate motion and costume changes into a multi-sprite conversation. The majority of fourth grade students from the second school, where reading and math comprehension scores fall below the state minimum requirements for proficiency, were unable to demonstrate a basic understanding of the programming tasks. The results suggest that fourth grade students who read at grade level are capable of understanding the relationships between multiple concerns within a single script, along with synchronizing a single concern across multiple scripts, but are challenged when synchronizing multiple concerns across multiple scripts.

In this paper, the concept of computational logistics for CTLS is proposed above all, and then the instruction sets, resource constraints, and operating environments for CTLS abstract machines are defined on the basis of the similarities and differences between computer systems and CTLS. Subsequently, CTLS are discussed from the perspective of asymmetric single-ISA multi-core processors (AMP) in detail within the conceptual framework of computational logistics and generalized computing. Consequently, a container terminal computational logistics model is presented with computing architecture and central properties of AMP.

Further investigating the relationship between fluid intelligence and computational thinking allows a better understanding of the main set of cognitive skills which need to be developed by students and professionals that aim to work in this domain.

However, there are reports that indicate that students learning to program in this environment show certain habits that are contrary to the basic programming recommendations. In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects. The results obtained show that, in general, projects in the repository also incur in the investigated malpractices.

  journal = {Proceedings - 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2015}},
  abstract = {An important task in engineering is the numerical design of structures. The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive ("wait-And-see") and active ("here-And-now") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps. Efficient approximate metamodels are, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks, and Extreme Learning Machines. The applicability of approach are demonstrated by means of engineering examples. © 2015 IEEE.}},

Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education.

First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment.

Building on earlier work, we claim that the systemslevel cognitive model LIDA (for 'Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent') offers a number of specific advantages for modeling diagnostic thinking. The LIDA Model employs a consciousness mechanism in an iterative cognitive cycle of understanding, attention, and action, endowing it with the ability to integrate multiple sensory modalities into flexible, dynamic, multimodal representations according to strategies that support specific task demands. These representations enable diverse, asynchronous cognitive processes to be dynamically activated according to rapidly changing contexts, much like in biological cognition. The recent completion of the LIDA Framework, a software API supporting the domain-independent LIDA Model, allows the construction of domain-specific agents that test the Model and/or enhance traditional machine learning algorithms with human-style problem solving. Medical Agent X (MAX) is a medical diagnosis agent under development using the LIDA Model and Framework.

However, in the effort to determine if an artefact is creative by human standards, it is also important to examine the perception of creativity by humans and to which extend this perception can be formalized and applied on the evaluation of creative works. In this paper, we investigate how the human perception for creativity exhibited in text artefacts can be predicted using appropriate formulations of computational creativity metrics. To this end, we designed and executed a storytelling experiment assisted by the usage of computational tools.

  abstract = {The age of ubiquitous/pervasive/ambient computing is upon us. We see more and more connected objects and devices embedded in everyday life. Design and Human-Computer Interaction are crucial components of information technologies that color our experience. As designers and technologists, we have the unique opportunity to imagine, design and create interesting, intelligent and interactive technologies for a smart living environment. A smart living environment is responsive, reconfigurable and transformable, embedded with sensors and actuators, to support everyday happy, healthy living with things that think, spaces that sense and places that play. Specifically, we see opportunity for investigating creative design computing to consider the built environment as an interface. We aim to engage people in playful, creative ways in which computing technologies embedded in the built environment (e.g., objects, furniture, building, and space) can support everyday happy healthy living. We build wellness technologies in different scales (e.g., in human-centered view: hand, body and environment), for various applications (e.g., to support emotional, physical, and intellectual wellness) to unlock human potential and augmenting human capabilities through digital design innovations. Opportunities exist for integrating multidisciplinary perspectives together to create innovation with impacts. For example, the Mobile Music Touch, a light-weight fingerless instrumented glove provides passive haptic learning of piano playing but also works as an effective rehabilitation tool. The ClockMe system, not only converts traditional pencil-and-paper Clock Drawing Test on a digital tablet for automatic scoring and analysis for detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders but also provides more information of the drawing behavior such as drawing sequence and pressure. The Digital Box and Block Test employs image processing to automatically detect and record a clinically validated post-stroke rehabilitation assessment for in-home use and a tangible gaming system to increase patient motivation. The Dodo game provides pictures of cute animals for color matching, and serves as a clinical screening test to detect color deficiency in young children. The Taste + bottle and spoon provide stimulation to alter the sense of taste without any chemical flavoring using electric pluses and color LED lights. It could encourage water drinking or enhance taste for people with restrictive diets or diminished taste sensations. The Sensorendipity is a real-time smartphonebased web-enabled sensor platform for designers to create sensor-based applications such as monitoring activities, in exergaming or safe driving. Now is an exciting time to engage in creative design computing, to implement physically and computationally enhanced environment, to explore experience media, to build prototypes, towards a smart living environment. Advancing technology offers new ways to solve problems, discover opportunities, and create new objects and experience that delight our senses and improve the way we live and work. Let's begin with the spark of creativity and enthusiasm and follow up with design and computational thinking towards the goal of creating unique technology for everyone.}},

Over the last two decades, new computational technologies, information, and communication have emerged, creating comprehensive cyberinfrastructurebased service systems, or what is termed here e-science. E-science environments are virtual systems that support data management, data mining, information acquisition, visualization, computing services, and people collaboration over the Web. Although a number of attempts have been successful in utilizing escience environments to change how research is conducted, using e-science environments for education has been rarely realized. This chapter describes a project that aims to transform Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education through using e-science systems at the undergraduate level. The strategy is built on three arms: (1) injecting Computational Thinking (CT) in STEM education; (2) using e-science for STEM learning; and (3) building a community-of-practice around e-science. By using e-science resources and services, an inquiry-based approach to learning can be the key to students' motivations, achievements, and enthusiasm for science. © 2014 by IGI Global.

The main goal of this report is to help teachers, those involved in teacher education, and decision makers to make informed decisions about how and when CT can be included in their local institutions. We begin by defining CT and then discuss the current state of CT in K-9 education in multiple countries in Europe as well as the United States. Since many students are exposed to CT outside of school, we also discuss the current state of informal educational initiatives in the same set of countries. An important contribution of the report is a survey distributed to K-9 teachers, aiming at revealing to what extent different aspects of CT are already part of teachers' classroom practice and how this is done. The survey data suggest that some teachers are already involved in activities that have strong potential for introducing some aspects of CT. In addition to the examples given by teachers participating in the survey, we present some additional sample activities and lesson plans for working with aspects of CT in different subjects. We also discuss ways in which teacher training can be coordinated as well as the issue of repositories. We conclude with future directions for research in CT at school. Copyright © 2014 ACM.}},

  abstract = {We analyze data from nearly 2 million text messages (tweets) across over 16,000 users on Twitter to examine differences between Christians and atheists in natural language. Analyses reveal that Christians use more positive emotion words and less negative emotion words than atheists. Moreover, two independent paths predict differences in expressions of happiness: frequency of words related to an intuitive (vs. analytic) thinking style and frequency of words related to social relationships. These findings provide the first evidence that the relationship between religion and happiness is partially mediated by thinking style. This research also provides support for previous laboratory studies and self-report data, suggesting that social connection partially mediates the relationship between religiosity and happiness. Implications for theory and the future of social science using computational methods to analyze social media are discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.}},

  journal = {IEEE Access}},
  abstract = {From an engineering point-of-view, cognitive control is inspired by the prefrontal cortex of the human brain; cognitive control may therefore be viewed as the overarching function of a cognitive dynamic system. In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional Q-learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning. © 2014 IEEE.}},

From MRPL and RPLs extending from it, there are three levels of application, i.e., the global level governing how people organize agents to form a group; the concatenative level for role assignment with respect to logic and algebra, and the operational level governing properties, relations and structures that should appear in collaborative system design.

Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards 'learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the 'power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the 'approach to teaching and learning programming.' © 2014 IEEE.}},

In a complex decision making scenario, which requires maintaining high level of attention continuously and deep understanding about the task and its context, the use of embodied interaction has the potential to promote thinking and learning. Creating a framework that allows decision makers to interact with information using the whole body in intuitive ways may offer cognitive advantages and greater efficiency. This paper proposes such a computational framework based on a Bayesian approach (coined BAN) to infer operators' focus of attention based on the operators' physical expressions. Then, utility theory is adopted in order to determine the best combinations of interaction modalities and feedback. Experiments involving five physical interaction modalities (touchless, glove-based, and step gestures, speech, and body balance) and two feedback modalities (visual and sound) were conducted to assess the proposed framework's performance. This also includes the likelihood of assessed attention from enhanced BANs and task performance as a function of the interaction and control modalities. Results show that physical expressions have a determining factor in the quality of the solutions in spationavigational type of problems. © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The desire to expose more students to computer science has led to the development of a plethora of educational activities[16, 7, 15, 4] and outreach programs to broaden participation in computer science. Despite extensive resources (time and money), they have made little impact on the diversity of students pursuing computer science. To realize large gains, computational thinking must be integrated into K-12 systems, starting with elementary school. In order to do so, existing resources need to be adapted for a school setting. In order to make a curriculum with lessons that build on each other over several years, and accountability for student learning, we need standards, an understanding of how students learn, and identification of what students know before exposure to the curriculum. In this paper, we present our detailed findings of what fourth graders know before encountering a computational thinking curriculum. Groups of students participated in activities modified from CS Unplugged[4] in order to discover their knowledge (rather than provide instruction). We identify aspects of the activities students were able to complete successfully, and where they will need further instruction. We then explain how we used these results to modify our pilot curriculum.}},

Using the Whimbey Analytical Skills Inventory (WASI) students in the CS0 class, along with students in an analogous level engineering class (FESP), were tested at the beginning of the course and again at the end, using different versions of the test. The improvement in scores was statistically significant when measured by both the student t-test and the Cohen d (effect size) for CS0 students but not for the FESP students, providing support that the course does, in fact, increase student analytical problem solving skills. Courses in Computational Thinking have demonstrated success in many schools; however, this research demonstrates its effectiveness in improving analytical skills in majors as well as non-majors.}},

  year = {2014}},
  journal = {Proceedings - 2014 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Computing and Engineering, LATICE 2014}},
  abstract = {Some complex problems in the computational area are learning programming and algorithms. Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as 'processes or outcomes' [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire: -There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Win steps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test: -The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs: -Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning. © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The existing trends and growing tendency to high-performance computing strongly require traditional computational algorithms to be revised in such a way that would permit optimal hardware implementations to be found. The latter can be done if algorithms can efficiently be mapped to hardware-specific functional blocks that require different style of thinking and manipulation by different operations and memory models. Besides, concurrency (pipelining and parallelism) can be widely applied. This paper focuses on data processing algorithms that use values of incoming data items as memory addresses with one-bit flags indicating presence or absence of data. The main problem of similar known methods is an appearance of huge number of memory cells with no data items (empty holes), which, nevertheless, have to be processed involving lots of unnecessary time. It is proposed to apply N-ary tree technique that enables data items to be stored and found very fast through executing special traversal procedure. Such trees completely differ from known tree-walk tables because they have pre-established configuration that does not require explicit addresses of subsequent (child) nodes. As a result the size of memory needed to keep data items is decreased in number of times. Finally, significantly more complicated problems can be solved faster and with smaller hardware resources. The presented results of numerous experiments clearly demonstrate advantages of the proposed method compared to known implementations. © 2013 IEEE.}},

The necessity to expand the computing curriculum across a wider range of schools and university courses for students who are not majoring in Computer Science (CS) ) it is well-documented in literature [1], as is the difficulty of teaching 21st century skills (www.p21.org.

The GIS functionality is hard to identify and use without specific training of GIS skills because of the complex hierarchical organization and the gap between users' spatial thinking and systems' implement descriptions. In order to bridge this gap, we propose a semantic framework for designing a question-based user interface that integrates different levels of ontologies (spatial concept ontology, domain ontology and task ontology) to guide the process of extracting the core spatial concepts and translating them into a set of equivalent computational or operational GIS tasks. We also list some typical spatial questions that might be posed for spatial analysis and computation. The principle introduced in this paper could be applied not only to desktop-GIS software but also to web map services. The semantic framework would be useful to enhance the ability of spatial reasoning in web search engines (e.g. Google semantic search) and answering questions in location-based services as well (e.g. iPhone Siri assistant). © 2013 IEEE.}},

To this end, we have designed and administered a test for computational thinking ability, and contrasted the results of this test with the class marks for the students involved. The results of this test give us an initial view of the abilities that students possess when entering the computer science course. The results indicate that students who performed well in the assessment have a favourable pass rate for their class tests, and specific areas of weakness have been identified. Finally, we describe the plan for a follow-up test to take place at the end of the course to determine how students' abilities have changed over a semester of studies. Copyright 2013 ACM.}},

  journal = {Exploring Multimodal Composition and Digital Writing}},
  abstract = {By utilizing digital tools that are nearly ubiquitous in the lives of youth, writing teachers can leverage these practices for developing traditional English language arts instruction and skills proposed by state and federal standards. In this chapter, the authors propose how the development of computational literacies through multimodal writing and video game design can help guide critical and academic development in an inner-city Los Angeles public school. In a research project where high school youth designed and created (programmed) a video game about an issue significant in their lives, students demonstrated their critical computational literacies, a concept that blends the critical consciousness of critical literacy and the skills and concepts behind computational thinking. Critical computational literacy offers the ability to integrate two seemingly divergent fields. By using these new media tools, students developed a more expansive and sophisticated way to communicate their ideas. This has significant possibilities for the English Language Arts, where most K-12 state standards still relegate students' literacies to overindulgence of traditional means of reading and writing of text. In an ever-evolving culture that increasingly places more significance on visual, auditory, and textual stimuli through multimodal media on computers and mobile devices (Hull & Nelson, 2005; Jenkins, 2006; Kress, 2010), schools must educate students to critically "read" messages in the media, and in turn become effective producers of these tools of communication (Alvermann, et al., 1999; Margolis, 2008; Morrell, 2008). This research shows students engaged in deep, reflective processes in the production of their multimodal texts. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.}},

Using artificial intelligence (AI) to drawing, thinking, and problem solving becomes a significant topic. Recently, research on automatic composition using AI technology and especially evolutionary algorithms is blooming and has received promising results. A common issue at the current evolutionary composition systems is their requirement for subjective feedback of human sensation as evaluation criterion, which is vulnerable to the fatigue and decreased sensitivity after long-time listening. This paper proposes using music theory with the information from music charts in the evaluation criterion to address this issue. Specifically, we generate the weighted rules based on music theory for the fitness function. The weights are determined according to the download numbers from music charts. These weights obtained can interpret the music style and render an objective measure of compositions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve satisfactory compositions. © 2013 IEEE.}},

Moreover, educational programming has always been one of the key components of this subject. In this paper, we report on one of our on-going research activities in the area of building and integrating our conception of educational programming into regular primary Informatics. Namely, we present the process and findings of a qualitative study, in which we develop and verify a new approach to designing programming tasks for primary students. We want to understand what cognitive demands these tasks pose to primary students, what the students consider difficult and what they consider easy - we are in search of better pedagogy for the primary programming education. To meet these goals, we need to identify elementary cognitive operations in primary programming and on the basis of that learn how to be more competent in considering the level of difficulty of the programming tasks and how to design proper gradational sequences (gradations) of tasks, which will support smooth learning process of the primary students' programming skills and early computational thinking - carefully respecting developmental appropriateness of these activities.

  abstract = {Spin glasses are disordered magnetic systems that have led to the development of mathematical tools with an array of real-world applications, from airline scheduling to neural networks. Spin Glasses and Complexity offers the most concise, engaging, and accessible introduction to the subject, fully explaining what spin glasses are, why they are important, and how they are opening up new ways of thinking about complexity. This one-of-a-kind guide to spin glasses begins by explaining the fundamentals of order and symmetry in condensed matter physics and how spin glasses fit into-and modify-this framework. It then explores how spin-glass concepts and ideas have found applications in areas as diverse as computational complexity, biological and artificial neural networks, protein folding, immune response maturation, combinatorial optimization, and social network modeling. Providing an essential overview of the history, science, and growing significance of this exciting field, Spin Glasses and Complexity also features a forward-looking discussion of what spin glasses may teach us in the future about complex systems.

The strategy design for these games also has to be different. Hence the paper proposes a new model for the design of game strategy by generalising the approach. Virtual generation of various strategies with the inter-application of basic strategies and complex strategies from various set of games into one another is the proposed algorithm. This gives a new approach entirely to the modelling of game strategies. It does so with the help of trained networks which are dynamically created and virtually maintained.

In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results. © 2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface. © 2012 IEEE.}},

Despite the clear realization of the immense power of chemical strategies in biology and medicine, the discovery of effective small molecule modulators for a particular biological target or phenotype remains a daunting challenge. While “omics” studies have revealed an expansive landscape of various biological systems and disease models, only a limited number of defined, biologically active compounds are available for functional exploration and for therapeutic discovery. Meanwhile, an expanding research area that uses information from genomes to develop chemical modulators for biology and therapeutics is rapidly developing due to major advances in chemistry, biology, and genomics, coupled with laboratory automation and computational technologies. This new field, chemical genomics, holds promise for transforming biological research and medicine using the power of chemistry. The book Chemical Genomics offers a collection of insightful contributions from international experts in the field and aims to further the study of chemical genomics. It covers a range of essential topics, including the basic principles of chemical biology and chemical genomics (Section One: Overviews), the fundamentals of chemical libraries (Section Two: Molecules for Chemical Genomics), the essentials of high-throughput screening and high-content screening (Section Three: Basics of High-Throughput Screening), and the design of innovative biochemical, cellular, and organismal bioassays and computational screening approaches (Section Four: Chemical Genomics Assays and Screens). The final section (Section Five: Chemical Genomics and Medicine) includes chapters that link chemical genomics with the movement toward personalized medicine and the druggable genome of the future. In selected chapters, a resource section is presented for further information. My hope is that this book provides an introduction to the principles of chemical genomics; serves as a resource for the associated technologies; and gives readers general concepts, useful vocabulary, practical techniques, and broad, forward-thinking perspectives. © Cambridge University Press 2012.}},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge to computer science education is the difficulty of broadening participation of women and underserved communities. The idea of game design and game programming as an activity to introduce children at an early age to computational thinking in a motivational way is quickly gaining momentum. A pedagogical approach called Project First has allowed the Scalable Game Design project to reach a large group of middle schools students including a large percentage of female (45%) and underrepresented (48%) students. With over 4000 students in inner city, remote rural, and Native American communities Scalable Game Design has investigated the impact on students' interest level of pedagogical approaches employed by teachers such as mediation and scaffolding. Findings suggest strong gender effects based on classroom scaffolding approaches. For instance, girls are substantially less likely to be motivated through scaffolding based on direct instruction. Conversely, guided discovery scaffolding approaches are highly motivating to the point where they can even overcome other negative predictors such as small girls to boys class participation ratios. This paper introduces the project, discusses different scaffolding approaches and presents data connecting gender specific motivational levels with scaffolding approaches. © 2012 ACM.}},

We describe key instructional principles and techniques used to minimize the complexity of this computational tool, thus enabling students to focus on the tasks and reasoning requirements of the design project. While encouraged by the high degree of students' motivation for building functioning animated mechanical toys (AMTs), students frequently reported being lost in SolidWorks (SW) during the modeling phases of the project. Our techniques for scaffolding learning activities have continued to evolve to minimize the challenges faced by novice users of SW and to better support them in developing their spatial thinking skills. We also present our experiences, lessons learned, and ideas for improving the design of the project, and learning activities, such as worked examples of an AMT model, to further reduce the cognitive load and to enable students to focus on visual-spatial reasoning rather than on the tacit skills associated with using SolidWorks. © 2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In the global context, the population of cities and urbanized areas has developed from a minority to become the majority. Now cities are the largest, most complex and most dynamic man-made systems. They are vibrant centres of cultural life and engines that drive local and global economies. Yet, contemporary urbanized areas are environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable entities laying increasing pressure on the surrounding rural areas. Traditional methods of planning and managing large cities that lead to this situation have reached their limits. The planning and design processes therefore need a radical re-thinking. On the computational side, this necessitates the integration of new methods and instruments. On the planning and design side, this requires the involvement of stakeholders and decision makers much earlier than normally done in the past. The combination of interactive design and computation will demonstrate the effects and side effects of urban-rural planning or re-development. We build our design research approach on dynamics and scale: viewing cities and settlements as entities with dynamic urban metabolisms, we propose to apply stocks and flows simulations to the building scale (small, S-Scale), to the urban scale (medium, M-Scale), and to the territorial scale (large, L-Scale). Our long-term goal is the sustainable urban-rural system.

  abstract = {Recursive reasoning of the form what do I think that you think that I think (and so on) arises often while acting in multiagent settings. Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way. While we do not claim the cognitive plausibility of the models in the absence of more evidence, they represent promising steps toward understanding and computationally simulating strategic human behavior. © 2012 IEEE.}},

NEO is designed to investigate systems we describe as complex adaptive hierarchical networks (CAHNs - complex systems represented as networks that route and store multiple interactive currencies). Models built atop NEO, are organized collections of individual values (model variables) and algorithms (model logic).

The problem is the existence of some insuperable barriers for our mind, another words barriers for principles of thinking. They are our clue and main reason for research. Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture. We start to express our thoughts in a language of mathematics, developing an apparatus for our Spatial Theory of Mind, suitable to represent processes and infrastructure of thinking. We use abstract algebra and stay invariant in relation to the nature of objects. © 2011 IEEE.}},

Computational thinking is advocated as not only a fundamental skill or concept in computer science but also a core competency for all disciplines. Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving. © 2011 IEEE.}},

In SAGD, youth are introduced to the STEM principles underlying modern computer games through a two-part curriculum that takes a reverse engineering approach to educational game design. It begins with Gamestar Mechanic, a web-based role-playing game that encourages students to think of games as systems made up of game-specific components and principles that are learned by playing games, repairing dysfunctional games, and creating new ones for sharing and critique in an online communities [1]. The second part encourages them to learn to use these design principles and apply them to solving of problems requiring computational thinking [2] within the design of games centered on STEM subjects using Microsoft Kodu, a Microsoft 3D game creation tool. Globaloria is a learning environment designed for middle school classrooms where students learn STEM concepts in the process of learning to design computer games using the Adobe Flash platform. Globaloria classrooms are designed around constructionist pedagogies, and feature a project-based curriculum supported by a framework of Web 2.0 technologies, and an online community of school classrooms, educators, and professional game designers. Using multimodal content and discourse analysis, the study examined the evolution of students' STEM learning and literacy in these two contexts, as a function of their changes in language use, design strategies, and game artifact production. Findings suggest that scaffolded game design can provide an effective context for students to develop deep understandings and engagement with STEM subjects, in forms valued within the 21st century workplace.

By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged.

This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students?' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students?' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts.

Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of holonic granule as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems.

As David Hemmendinger said in a thought piece that appeared recently in ACM Inroads: "Teaching computational thinking [to students in disciplines other than computer science]⋯ is to teach them how to think like an economist, a physicist, an artist, and to understand how to use computation to solve their problems, to create, and to discover new questions that can be fruitfully explored." [1]. As a consequence of this way to think about a proper role for computational thinking, what is emerging is a new discipline, computational science, that brings to bear the knowledge and tools of mathematics, statistics and computer science to solve problems in the sciences and engineering. This multidisciplinary approach is also leading to the creation of new scientific knowledge. In the past few years computational science programs, both at the undergraduate and the graduate level, have been springing up at a number of colleges and universities. This panel is designed to explore this relatively new phenomenon. Each of the panelists has been a leader at her/his institution in the development of such programs. And, each will present what led them to take on this task, how they went about building a program, some of the features of each program and some of the successes and failures.}},

  abstract = {Networks-on-chip (NoCs) have been proposed as a viable solution to solving the communication problem in multicore systems. In this new setup, mapping multiple applications on available computational resources leads to interaction and contention at various network resources. Consequently, taking into account the traffic characteristics becomes of crucial importance for performance analysis and optimization of the communication infrastructure, as well as proper resource management. Although queuing-based approaches have been traditionally used for performance analysis purposes, they cannot properly account for many of the traffic characteristics (e.g., non-stationarity, self-similarity) that are crucial for multicore platform design. To overcome these limitations, we propose a statistical physics inspired approach to capture the traffic dynamics in multicore systems. As shown later in this paper, this is of fundamental significance for re-thinking the very basis of multicore systems design; it also opens up new research directions into NoC optimization which require accurate models of time-dependent and space-dependent traffic behavior. © 2006 IEEE.}},

Thinking in large, it should be apparent that modeling social systems allowing to study crowd behavior emerging from individual entities' (agents') condition and/or characteristics is, in fact, a challenging task. To address the heterogeneity, analytical agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining popularity due to its capability of directly representing individual entities and their interactions, unfortunately, ABMs (in which each agent has unique behavior) are not very well suited for large populations, expressed by exponentially rising simulation time. To solve this problem, the questions (i) how does the parallel execution of such models scale with capabilities of both the machine (number of cores, cluster size, etc.) and agents (behavioral adaptation function, interaction extent, etc.) and (ii) what is, in comparison, the performance coefficient applying the approach of model execution on graphical processors (GPUs) with its different pipelining architecture, need answers. To this end, we have performed simulation runs with parameter variation on a real parallel and distributed hardware platform using Cilk as well as on a GPU employing OpenCL. Simulation efficiency for two realistic models with varying complexity on a scale of 107 agents has shown the usefulness of both approaches. © 2011 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Visual programming languages can be used to make computer science more accessible to a broad range of students. The evaluative focus of current research in the area of visual languages for educational purposes primarily aims to better understand motivational benefits as compared to traditional programming languages. Often these visual languages claim to teach students computational thinking concepts; however, although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not always clear what computational thinking concepts students have actually learned. In this paper we attempt to develop a visual semantic evaluation tool for student-created games and simulations that goes towards depicting the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students. Through semantically analyzing a given student's created projects over time, this visual evaluation tool, called the Computational Thinking Pattern (CTP) graph, can possibly indicate the existence of computational thinking transfer from games to science simulations. © 2010 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this is to add both to the development of complex systems thinking in the subject area of operations and production management and to the limited number of applications of computational models and simulations from the science of complex systems. The latter potentially offer helpful decision-support tools for operations and production managers. Design/methodology/approach: A mechanical engineering firm was used as a case study where a combined qualitative and quantitative methodological approach was employed to extract the required data from four senior managers. Company performance measures as well as firm technologies, practices and policies, and their relation and interaction with one another, were elicited. The data were subjected to an evolutionary complex systems (ECS) model resulting in a series of simulations. Findings: The findings highlighted the effects of the diversity in management decision making on the firm's evolutionary trajectory. The CEO appeared to have the most balanced view of the firm, closely followed by the marketing and research and development managers. The manufacturing manager's responses led to the most extreme evolutionary trajectory where the integrity of the entire firm came into question particularly when considering how employees were utilised. Research limitations/implications: By drawing directly from the opinions and views of managers, rather than from logical "if-then" rules and averaged mathematical representations of agents that characterise agent-based and other self-organisational models, this work builds on previous applications by capturing a micro-level description of diversity that has been problematical both in theory and application. Practical implications: This approach can be used as a decision-support tool for operations and other managers providing a forum with which to explore: the strengths, weaknesses and consequences of different decision-making capacities within the firm; the introduction of new manufacturing technologies, practices and policies; and the different evolutionary trajectories that a firm can take. Originality/value: With the inclusion of "micro-diversity", ECS modelling moves beyond the self-organisational models that populate the literature but has not as yet produced a great many practical simulation results. This work is a step in that direction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.}},

  abstract = {Cognitive Science appeared about 40 years ago, subsequent to the challenge of the Artificial Intelligence, as common territory for several scientific disciplines such as: IT, mathematics, psychology, neurology, philosophy, sociology, and linguistics. The new born science was justified by the complexity of the problems related to the human knowledge on one hand, and on the other by the fact that none of the above mentioned sciences could explain alone the mental phenomena. Based on the data supplied by the experimental sciences such as psychology or neurology, models of the human mind operation are built in the cognition science. These models are implemented in computer programs and/or electronic circuits (specific to the artificial intelligence) - cognitive systems - whose competences and performances are compared to the human ones, leading to the psychology and neurology data reinterpretation, respectively to the construction of new models. During these processes if psychology provides the experimental basis, philosophy and mathematics provides the abstraction level utterly necessary for the intermission of the mentioned sciences. The ongoing general problematic of the cognitive approach provides two important types of approach: the computational one, starting from the idea that the mental phenomenon can be reduced to 1 and 0 type calculus operations, and the connection one that considers the thinking products as being a result of the interaction between all the composing (included) systems. In the field of psychology measurements in the computational register use classical inquiries and psychometrical tests, generally based on calculus methods. Deeming things from both sides that are representing the cognitive science, we can notice a gap in psychological product measurement possibilities, regarded from the connectionist perspective, that requires the unitary understanding of the quality - quantity whole. In such approach measurement by calculus proves to be inefficient. Our researches, deployed for longer than 20 years, lead to the conclusion that measuring by forms properly fits to the connectionism laws and principles.}},

Furthermore, as computation becomes the cornerstone of research methodologies, if not professional practice, in the natural, physical and social sciences, including, as well, a growing influence in the humanities, the demand from external departments/programs for non-major level service courses has began to rise, albeit slowly. This raises some interesting questions to the CSE community. Given that one offers a single non-major level course, what should be the topics covered as distinct from the technologies used to convey those topics? What learning outcomes are most desired? Finally, the competency, or at least serious introduction of which technological skills, if any, should be considered mandatory (e.g. programming). In short, what should a non-major/minor student who takes one course in computer science come away with knowing and being able to do?

Our CPACE (Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering Workforce Needs) vision is to revitalize undergraduate computing education within the engineering and technology fields. Our objective is to design and implement a process to engage stakeholders from multiple sectors and identify the computational tools and problem-solving skills and define how these skills-directly informed by industry needs-can be integrated across disciplinary curricula. By explicitly integrating computing concepts and disciplinary problem solving, engineering graduates will enter the workforce with improved and practice-ready computational thinking that will enhance their problemsolving and design skills. We present the analysis of the computational skills and the strategies that we are using to map the workforce problem-solving requirements onto the foundational computer science principles. We outline the framework that we are using to identify opportunities for curricular integration between computer science concepts and the disciplinary engineering curricula. By documenting, evaluating, and making the process explicit, this process can serve as a model for national efforts to strengthen undergraduate computing education in engineering. ©2009 IEEE.}},

The latter is the core of non-determinism, asynchronous execution, and arbitrary choices in deterministic algorithms. The two notions are not intuitive, and require abstraction. We expect computer science (CS) graduates, who developed computational thinking during their studies, to demonstrate comprehension of these notions. Unfortunately, this may not be the case. In this paper we present a study of CS graduates, which reveals difficulties of limited comprehension and acceptance of these notions.

In addition, as the insert operation of each point is independent, the algorithm has high parallelism. And because the insert operations will not cause the imbalance of the tree structure, the M2M data structure is dynamic. Moreover, it can be shared by all the algorithms based on M2M model which greatly improves the efficiency when a variety of algorithms work simultaneity, such as in image processing and pattern recognition.

The declines come at a time when career opportunities in CS continue to grow and computer science graduates are seen as crucial in building a globally competitive workforce for the 21st century. Efforts aimed at reversing the declining interest in computer science include curriculum revisions at the undergraduate level at many institutions, a re-design of computer science AP courses [1], and the inclusion of computational thinking into disciplines outside computer science [3]. This panel discusses four projects of computer science researchers collaborating with high school teachers on integrating computing and computational thinking into their courses. The majority of the high school teachers involved is teaching science and math courses. They are teaching a diverse group of talented and college-bound students. The goal of all projects is to integrate computing into disciplines represented in the high school curriculum and to raise the awareness of computer science as an exciting and intellectually rewarding field. This panel will outline recent and on-going activities and interaction with high school teachers. Each panelist will describe how he/she got involved and the nature of the interaction. The panelists will talk about their individual projects, outline their visions for future interactions, and how their effort can be replicated by others. The session will briefly describe NSF's RET program which provided teacher support for three of the four projects.

Modern information technology has contributed to the enrichment of teaching and learning processes, especially in the fields of natural sciences and mathematics and those of production and technology. Simulation appears as a new possibility in the representation of knowledge. According to Guetzkow (1972) simulation is an operative representation of reality from a relevant aspect. It is about a model of an objective system, which is dynamic in itself. If that model is material it is a simple simulation, if it is abstract it is a reflective experiment, that is a computer simulation.

At our university, several departments have introduced new computer-based modeling courses that integrate critical thinking and problem solving with computational thinking and programming as a replacement of the traditional first computer programming course. The skills learned in such freshman level courses are being iterated and expanded on in subsequent courses in these curricula in order to create a 'computational thinking thread'. One unforeseen consequence of the computer based modeling course was an increase in the student's problem solving ability. This study explores the role that computing has on student's problem solving abilities and tries to quantify its impact. Students in several freshman and senior level engineering courses across different disciplines were asked to solve a common problem solving task as well as reflect on the process they used to solve the problem. The student's solutions were scored using a protocol based on Wolcott's 'Steps for better thinking rubric' The paper will outline the problem used; report on the scoring procedures and methodology; and present the results from the study.

For example, the three R's (reading, 'riting & 'rithmetic) are core to a strong fundamental education, and practitioners and researchers routinely apply these tools to their daily work. Computing has become an essential and pervasive problemsolving toolset. This development has fostered much discussion about the role of computing in a modern education, the broadening nature of computing majors and concentrations and their place in post-secondary institutions, for example, [6,7]. Computer science educators recognize the importance of improving information technology (IT) skills and fluency, and a number of studies have developed guidelines on how to do this [3,4]. However, computer science has analytical concepts and tools that offer educational benefits beyond simple IT fluency. Computational thinking was introduced [9] as a continuation of earlier discussions on the nature of computing (e.g. [5]). Similar discussions and the same terminology were introduced independently in a series of workshops and reports [2]. This has helped the computing community to strengthen description and definition of the problem solving skills that computing brings to society, through education, outreach, and research.Over the past few years, computational thinking concepts have served as a basis for several projects, workshops and efforts aimed at more precise, and at the same time, deeper and wider interpretation of computing. This includes attention to K-12 curricula, general education at colleges and universities, as well as interdisciplinary research and technology transfer. This panel will outline a sampling of the activities and projects that have begun to define and address computational thinking. The moderator will start with an outline of national computational thinking activities and developments. The panelists will talk about their individual projects and activities, and outline their visions for future developments in the computing and broader educational communities around computational thinking.

This dynamics is shaped by external information on task context, constraints and goals, and is modulated by evaluative feedback from an internal critic working through reinforcement. While the model is abstract, it attempts to capture the interplay between semantic representations in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, working memory in the prefrontal cortex, attentional selection by the basal ganglia, and modulation from the dopaminergic reward system. We show that a context-specific itinerant search for novel but meaningful conceptual combinations (ideas) emerges naturally from the dynamics of this system. We also briefly describe a computational model for ideation in groups using a multiagent formalism. The initial focus of this model is on studying the potential benefits of cognitive diversity in agent groups, e.g., the presence of convergent and divergent thinkers, or agents with different semantic organizations. © 2009 IEEE.}},

Equations play a central role in problem solving across various fields of study. Understanding what an equation means is an essential step toward forming an effective strategy to solve it, and it also lays the foundation for a more successful and fulfilling work experience. Thinking About Equations provides an accessible guide to developing an intuitive understanding of mathematical methods and, at the same time, presents a number of practical mathematical tools for successfully solving problems that arise in engineering and the physical sciences. Equations form the basis for nearly all numerical solutions, and the authors illustrate how a firm understanding of problem solving can lead to improved strategies for computational approaches. Eight succinct chapters provide thorough topical coverage, including: Approximation and estimation Isolating important variables Generalization and special cases Dimensional analysis and scaling Pictorial methods and graphical solutions Symmetry to simplify equations Each chapter contains a general discussion that is integrated with worked-out problems from various fields of study, including physics, engineering, applied mathematics, and physical chemistry. These examples illustrate the mathematical concepts and techniques that are frequently encountered when solving problems. To accelerate learning, the worked example problems are grouped by the equation-related concepts that they illustrate as opposed to subfields within science and mathematics, as in conventional treatments. In addition, each problem is accompanied by a comprehensive solution, explanation, and commentary, and numerous exercises at the end of each chapter provide an opportunity to test comprehension. Requiring only a working knowledge of basic calculus and introductory physics, Thinking About Equations is an excellent supplement for courses in engineering and the physical sciences at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and educators in all branches of engineering, physics, chemistry, biophysics, and other related fields who encounter mathematical problems in their day-to-day work. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc..}},

  journal = {Fuzzy Measurement of Sustainability}},
  abstract = {People from many disciplines talk about sustainable development (SD) without having a concrete definition or idea of what it is. Politicians and decision-makers, biologists and environmentalists, engineers and scientists, philosophers and sociologists often mean different things when they mention SD. To take an extreme example, a neoclassical economist might define SD as continual economic growth without regard to the environmental situation, whereas at the other end of the spectrum, a deep ecologist might define it as the preservation and restoration of the ecosystem, ignoring the effect on the economy completely. It has become clear throughout the last few decades leading up to the time this book was written that our society is facing environmental problems of global magnitude such as species extinction, population explosion, global warming, water shortages, exhaustion of fisheries, and deforestation, among others, which have economic and social repercussions. Many people doubt that the world we shall bequeath to our descendants will be all healthy, supportive, and beautiful as the one we inherited from our parents. The fundamental questions then of the SD discussion are: Can we continue our present course without destroying part or most of our environment and society? And if we have to change course (which is currently the consensus opinion) how we do it? This book addresses one of the most fundamental questions of SD: How do we define and measure in the mathematical sense sustainability? In effect it summarizes our research in this field for the last 15 years. The mathematical model which we use to evaluate sustainability serves both as a definition and as a measuring scheme. This is done with the help of fuzzy logic, which is well suited to perform reasoning in fields where concrete mathematical models do not exist and concepts such as sustainability are multifaceted and often subjective. Fuzzy reasoning, in some respects, emulates human thinking and relies on expert opinion and knowledge as well as subjective evaluations. This multistage model is developed step-by-step, in the end providing sustainability assessments of various aspects of a society on a scale from zero to one, such as the environmental or societal situation of a country. All nations of the world for which reliable data exist are then ranked according to their sustainability as measured by the model. A sensitivity analysis reveals the most important components of sustainability for each country. The book is intended for undergraduate students, graduate students, and practitioners working in the field of sustainability. It is based on a course Yannis Phillis has taught at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Technical University of Crete (TUC) at the senior/graduate level.The mathematical knowledge needed to follow the book is minimal and is all contained in the text. Computational guidance is provided for those who would like to write their own model. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {In complex strategic situations decision-making agents interact with many other agents and have access to many pieces of information throughout their play. This usually leads to game solving being a very complex, almost intractable procedure. Moreover, algorithms for solving games usually fail to explain how the various equilibria come about and how "plausible" they are. Reasoning patterns try to capture the strategic thinking of agents and formalize the usage of the various information or evidence they obtain during their interactions. Identifying reasoning patterns can lead to a significant refinement over the full range of equilibria, as well as considerable computational savings in solving the game. Here we present a polynomial-time algorithm that simplifies the original game by iteratively identifying non-effective (ignorable) decision nodes and removing redundant information edges. In some cases, this can lead to exponential-time savings in computing an equilibrium, yet some - potentially efficient-equilibria may be lost in the process. Copyright © 2008.}},

Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, students' programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased. Additionally, we found that students appear to strongly prefer such an approach, citing mostly emotive benefits, and that these effects may be particularly strong among women. © 2008 IEEE.}},

And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic.

In this contribution the "picture" concept, which has a long tradition in philosophy, serves as the starting point of an interpretation of the relationship between real systems and theoretical structures of modern science. In addition, the approach dubbed as the "structuralist" approach of scientific theories in the 20th century will be extended and enhanced by the concept of "fuzzy sets" and "fuzzy relations".

The coming of the digital times changes people's life style and thinking modes. The obvious characteristic of digital times is that it leads us into a real virtual world. The spread of mass culture goes along with the spread of mass media. The television, network and computer altogether constructs the virtual space of the times. The times of mass virtual culture is coming. The cognition and emotions of the artists living in the current times changed potentially. The artists eliminate the class gap between serious arts and popular culture through obtaining fashion, consumption, network, animation, and other popular pictures, and change the traditional artistic expressive methods and bring about new characteristics and changes to the works of arts through the borrowing of the inborn sensitivity of the pictures. This article takes the contemporary drawing works as an example to describe how the artists select the inclined theme and contents, and make use of various digital media and the mass popular culture, and form the virtual plots with Chinese contemporarity and rich imagination by the use of game and metaphor.

Since this problem tackling is mainly based on simple geometric and algebraic considerations a brief historical summary is given on the antecedents to exemplify the advantages of geometric way of thinking in Natural Sciences. Following that the most popular branches of the classical and novel, Soft Computing (SC) based robust and adaptive approaches are analyzed with especial emphasis on the supposed need and the consequences of obtaining complete, accurate, and permanent models either for the system to be controlled or to the control situation as a whole. Following that, in comparison to the above mentioned more traditional methods, our novel approach is summarized that has the less ambitious goal of obtaining only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent models that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the given actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing a simple iterative learning control for Single Input - Single Output (SISO) systems the conditions of the convergence of which is easy to satisfy by choosing very simple and primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters. Finally it will be shown how the most attractive mathematical properties of the fundamental symmetry groups of Natural Sciences can be utilized for the generalization of our approach to the control of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) systems.

  abstract = {Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic logic" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks. © 2007 IEEE.}},

QA system has attracted more attention to meet information needs providing users with more precise and focused retrieval answers. We proposed a Skolemize Clauses Binding (SCB) for reasoning, along with the theorem proving to provide the basis answer extraction. QA systems employing combination of SCB and resolution theorem proving have been used to provide both satisfying and hypothetical answers. Satisfying answers are associated with ground term corresponding with questions whose logical form contains variables. Hypothetical answer is an answer which comes from the story or plot of text, and required logical thinking because it is not explicitly stated in the knowledge domain. In this case, the answer can be considered as a set of logical formula called skolemize clauses defining sufficient conditions characteristic the tuples of individuals which satisfying the query. © 2007 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In early phases of design a wide exploration of the design space is crucial to the development of creative solutions. In this regard, Evolutionary Computation (EC), and in particular Genetic Algorithms, contain several qualities that can enhance exploration by opening the search process beyond the focus of finding a single "best" solution. Over the years many researchers in the area of creative thinking including Gordon, de Bono, Parnes, Osborn and others, have suggested design strategies that have interesting parallels in EC processes. For instance, a well known inhibitor of creative thinking is design fixation, where the suggestion of a particular solution makes it difficult to imagine other good solutions. Unlike many other computational search algorithms, EC methods work with populations of "fairly good" solutions. Therefore, there is less danger that creativity will be harmed by design fixation on one "best" solution. This paper shows through a specific example of a truss bridge how an EC based design exploration program can aid the designer by providing a selection of "pretty good" solutions rather than a single optimal solution. Other aspects of the EC program are also discussed including drawbacks to the method such as computational intensity as well as directions of future development.}},

  abstract = {Indexing deals with the automatic extraction of information with the objective of automatically describing and organizing the content. Thinking of a video stream, different types of information can be considered semantically important. Since we can assume that the most relevant one is linked to the presence of moving foreground objects, their number, their shape, and their appearance can constitute a good mean for content description. For this reason, we propose to combine both motion information and region-based color segmentation to extract moving objects from an MPEG2 compressed video stream starting only considering low-resolution data. This approach, which we refer to as "rough indexing," consists in processing P-frame motion information first, and then in performing I-frame color segmentation. Next, since many details can be lost due to the low-resolution data, to improve the object detection results, a novel spatiotemporal filtering has been developed which is constituted by a quadric surface modeling the object trace along time. This method enables to effectively correct possible former detection errors without heavily increasing the computational effort.}},

At the beginning of such a multiconfabulation, billions of distinct, potentially viable, conclusion sets are considered. At the end, only one remains. This fast, massively parallel application of relevant knowledge (an alien kind of information processing with no analogue in today's computational intelligence, computational neurobiology, or computer science) is hypothesized to be the core explanation for the information processing effectiveness of thought.

  abstract = {Dedicated to Gottfried Michael Koenig for his 80th birthday Although Algorithmic composition became popular with the rise of computers, algorithmic thinking is far older – it can be traced back to the ancient times of Pythagoras and the Jewish Kabbalah. It is a method of perceiving an abstract model behind the sensual surface, or in turn, of constructing such a model in order to create aesthetic works. Behind the various approaches there is one common denominator: a longing to create something infinite that exceeds the limited horizon of our individual knowledge. Seen in this light, algorithmic thinking and its application in the arts can become a way to gain experience and to overcome barriers that are either implicit in ourselves, or erected by our social environment. In this article, I am focusing exclusively on the use of algorithms in the compositional process, leaving aside other approaches like the algorithmic simulation of musical styles, the computational modelling of music cognition and the application of artificial intelligence techniques (Cope 1996; Ebcioglu 1990). My primary aim is to demonstrate how the algorithmic spirit has evolved through the centuries – from medieval music theory to the interactive realtime-generated computer music of today. Algorithm The term algorithm was phonetically derived from the name of the Arab mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (ninth century) who introduced Hindu–Arabic numerals and the concepts of algebra into European mathematics. An algorithm can be defined as a predetermined set of instructions for solving a specific problem in a limited number of steps. Algorithms can range from a mere succession of simple arithmetical operations to more complex combinations of procedures, utilising more involved constructions from computer science such as rule-based grammars, recursion and probabilistic inference. © Cambridge University Press 2007.}},

One of the first semiempirical approaches in quantum chemistry was the p-electron method proposed by HUckel (1931) that generates molecular orbitals (MOs) essentially from the connectivity matrix of a molecule and provides valuable qualitative insights into the structure, stability, and spectroscopy of unsaturated molecules. Hoffmann extended this approach to include all valence electrons and applied in many qualitative studies of inorganic and organometallic compounds. These early semiempirical methods had a lasting impact on chemical thinking as they guided the development of qualitative MO theory that is commonly employed for rationalizing chemical phenomena in terms of orbitals interactions. They are normally not used any longer as computational tools. After a survey of the established methods such as MNDO, AM1, and PM3, recent methodological advances are described including the development of improved semiempirical models, new general-purpose and special-purpose parametrizations, and linear scaling approaches. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Others (such as how to allow Toulmin diagrams to be recursive) are diagrammatic versions of questions that have already been addressed in artificial intelligence models of argument. But there are further questions (such as the relationships between refutations, rebuttals and undercutters, and the roles of multiple warrants) that are posed as a specific result of examining the diagram inter-translation problem.

  abstract = {Soft computing (SC) is an emerging collection of methodologies which aims to exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth to achieve robustness, tractability, and low total cost. It differs from conventional hard computing (HC) in the sense that, unlike hard computing, it is strongly based on intuition or subjectivity. Therefore, soft computing provides an attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty. Fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and genetic algorithms (GA) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL, NN, and GA should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary instead. Considering the number of available journal and conference papers on various combinations of these three methods, it is easy to conclude that the fusion of individual soft computing methodologies has already been advantageous in numerous applications. On the other hand, hard computing solutions are usually more straightforward to analyze; their behavior and stability are more predictable; and, the computational burden of algorithms is typically either low or moderate. These characteristics are particularly important in real-time applications. Thus, it is natural to see SC and HC as potentially complementary methodologies. Novel combinations of different methods are needed when developing high-performance, cost-effective, and safe products for the demanding global market. In this paper, we present an overview of applications in which the fusion of soft computing and hard computing has provided innovative solutions for challenging real-world problems. A carefully selected list of references is considered with evaluative discussions and conclusions.}},

  abstract = {The so called associative thinking, which humans are known to perform on every day basis, is attributed to the fact that human brain memorizes information using the dynamical system made of interconnected neurons. Retrieval of information in such a system is accomplished in associative sense; starting from an arbitrary state, which might be an encoded representation of a visual image, the brain activity converges to another state, which is stable and which is what the brain remembers. In this paper we explore the possibility of using an associative memory for the purpose of enhancing the interactive capability of perceptual vision systems. By following the biological memory principles, we show how vision systems can be designed to recognize faces, facial gestures and orientations, using low-end video-cameras and little computational power. In doing that we use the public domain associative memory code. © 2004 IEEE.}},

In particular, we propose a new way to realize the most constraining principle where at each step we gradually relax the constraints on the most constrained elements of the solution. This basic optimization mechanism is augmented with several new heuristic principles: minimal freedom reduction, negative thinking, calibration, simultaneous step consideration, and probabilistic modeling. We have successfully applied these optimization principles to a number of common behavioral synthesis tasks. Specifically, we demonstrate a systematic way to develop optimization algorithms for maximum independent set, time-constrained scheduling, and soft real-time system scheduling. The effectiveness of the approach and algorithms is validated on extensive real-life benchmarks.}},

The paper presents a fuzzy-neuro architecture for a computational model, handling the imprecision of human-like thinking on faults and behavior of the conductive flow systems in industry. The primary effects isolation from the secondary effects proceeds in a modular fashion, based on four transport anomalies detected on the flow power disturbance in each (bond graph) junction of interconnected components. The manifestations take a fuzzy representation and the multiple links between manifestations and faults is represented and processed by productive neural networks. The modular structure of the diagnosis system reflects the modular structure of the target system, hence the faults-effects mapping is simpler and the isolation of faults is more precise. © 1999 IEEE.}},

The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems in which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but even to find a good representation for them.

In addition, SC yields rich knowledge representation (symbol and pattern), flexible knowledge acquisition (by machine learning from data and by interviewing experts), and flexible knowledge processing (Inference by interfacing between symbolic and pattern knowledge), which enable intelligent systems to be constructed at low cost [high machine intelligence quotient (HMIQ)]. This paper reviews applications of SC in several industrial fields to show the various innovations by TR, HMIQ, and low cost in industries that have been made possible by the use ofSC.

  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems}},
  abstract = {Distributed Memory MultiComputers (DMMs), such as the IBM SP-2, the Intel Paragon, and the Thinking Machines CM-5, offer significant advantages over shared memory multiprocessors in terms of cost and scalability. Unfortunately, the utilization of all the available computational power in these machines involves a tremendous programming effort on the part of users, which creates a need for sophisticated compiler and run-time support for distributed memory machines. In this paper, we explore a new compiler optimization for regular scientific applications - the simultaneous exploitation of task and data parallelism. Our optimization is implemented as part of the PARADIGM HPF compiler framework we have developed. The intuitive idea behind the optimization is the use of task parallelism to control the degree of data parallelism of individual tasks. The reason this provides increased performance is that data parallelism provides diminishing returns as the number of processors used is increased. By controlling the number of processors used for each data parallel task in an application and by concurrently executing these tasks, we make program execution more efficient and, therefore, faster. A practical implementation of a task and data parallel scheme of execution for an application on a distributed memory multicomputer also involves data redistribution. This data redistribution causes an overhead. However, as our experimental results show, this overhead is not a problem; execution of a program using task and data parallelism together can be significantly faster than its execution using data parallelism alone. This makes our proposed optimization practical and extremely useful. © 1997 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The High Performance Fortran language is a 'standard by consensus', developed by individuals and vendors in the high performance computing industry, to provide a low barrier entry to parallel computing. It promises to be an easier to use development environment for distributed memory computing platforms compared to the programming complexity required by message passing libraries such as PVM and MPI. HPF promises much and is still in its infancy. Since HPF was developed in part based on experiences gained with early parallel Fortran compilers such as Thinking Machines CM Fortran, we decided to test the effectiveness of HPF with today's generation of HPF compilers by porting a complex existing model code originally developed using CM Fortran. The model code that we selected is a hybrid computational aeroacoustics code that solves the 3D, time-dependent Euler equations in the near flow field and uses a moving surface Kirchhoff's formula to predict the far field sound radiating from turbofan engine inlets. The original CM Fortran model code was developed on a Thinking Machines CM5. The extensive production research use of this model, using varying grid sizes, provides excellent benchmarks with which to compare the HPF port. Two HPF compilers were selected in the porting effort - The Portland Group's (PGI) pghpf and the xlhpf compiler from IBM. IBM's xlhpf does not implement some elements of the HPF subset while PGI's offering provides several full-HPF extensions. porting efforts using each compiler exposed the strengths and weaknesses of each. Porting this complex code exposed many of the growing pains associated with the current generation of compilers. Critical sections of the code will be explained and these critical areas of the conversion effort will be discussed. Where necessary we will demonstrate how different porting strategies affected the performance of the code. Finally we will present how the ported code ran, using a varying number of processors, on an IBM SP2 and an SGI Origin 2000. While the current simple port does not match the speed of a CM-5, we hope further porting efforts and improved compiler technology will enable us to eventually match and then surpass CM-5 performance levels. With the shutdown of the NCSA CM-5 and the eventual removal and failure of the remaining Thinking Machines hardware currently installed, this effort will demonstrate that investments in CM Fortran code need not be abandoned and that new life can be breathed into those dusty decks. © 1997 ACM.}},

One key to overcoming this bottleneck is improving the performance of multiprocessor file systems. The design of a high-performance multiprocessor file system requires a comprehensive understanding of the expected workload. Unfortunately, until recently, no general workload studies of multiprocessor file systems have been conducted. The goal of the CHARISMA project was to remedy this problem by characterizing the behavior of several production workloads, on different machines, at the level of individual reads and writes. The first set of results from the CHARISMA project describe the workloads observed on an Intel iPSC/860 and a Thinking Machines CM-5. This paper is intended to compare and contrast these two workloads for an understanding of their essential similarities and differences, isolating common trends and platform-dependent variances. Using this comparison, we are able to gain more insight into the general principles that should guide multiprocessor file-system design. ©1996 IEEE.}},

The solver is designed for distributed-memory, message-passing parallel computer systems. All phases of the computation, including symbolic processing as well as numeric factorization and triangular solution, are performed in parallel. A parallel Cartesian-nested dissection algorithm is used to compute a fill- reducing ordering for the matrix and an appropriate partitioning of the problem across the processors. The separator tree resulting from nested dissection is used to identify and exploit large-grain parallelism in the remaining steps of the computation. The parallel performance of the solver is reported for a series of test problems on the Thinking Machines CM-5 and the Intel Touchstone Delta. The parallel efficiency, scalability, and absolute performance of the solver, as well as the relative importance of the various phases of the computation, are investigated empirically.}},

  abstract = {This paper discusses how a behavior-based robot can construct a "symbolic process" that accounts for its deliberative thinking processes using models of the environment. The paper focuses on two essential problems; one is the symbol grounding problem and the other is how the internal symbolic processes can be situated with respect to the behavioral contexts. We investigate these problems by applying a dynamical system's approach to the robot navigation learning problem. Our formulation, based on a forward modeling scheme using recurrent neural learning, shows that the robot is capable of learning grammatical structure hidden in the geometry of the workspace from the local sensory inputs through its navigational experiences. Furthermore, the robot is capable of generating diverse action plans to reach an arbitrary goal using the acquired forward model which incorporates chaotic dynamics. The essential claim is that the internal symbolic process, being embedded in the attractor, is grounded since it is self-organized solely through interaction with the physical world. It is also shown that structural stability arises in the interaction between the neural dynamics and the environmental dynamics, which accounts for the situatedness of the internal symbolic process. The experimental results using a mobile robot, equipped with a local sensor consisting of a laser range finder, verify our claims. © 1996 IEEE.}},

Tests were run by porting CM Fortran codes to the Y-MP, so that nearly the same level of optimization was obtained on both machines. The results for fully-configured systems, using measured data rather than scaled data from smaller configurations, show that the Y-MP/8 is faster than the 64k CM-2 for all three codes. A simple model that accounts for the relative characteristic computational speeds of the two machines, and reduction in overall CM-2 performance due to communication or SIMD conditional execution, accurately predicts the performance of two of the three codes. Other factors, such as memory bandwidth and compiler effects, are also discussed. Finally, the paper shows the similarity of the CM-2 and Y-MP programming models, and also comments on selected future massively parallel processor designs. © 1992 IEEE.}},

On a 256 processor Cray T3D, the implementation outperforms all previous solutions by an order of magnitude. A characterization of graph parameters allows us to select graphs that highlight key performance features. We study the effects of these parameters and machine characteristics on the balance of time between the local and global phases of the algorithm and find that edge density, surface-to-volume ratio, and relative communication cost dominate performance.

Methods are needed to increase the speed of these computations for large data sets. Fortunately, wavelet decomposition is very amenable to parallelization. Coarse-grained parallel versions of this process have been design and implemented on three different architectures: a distributed network represented by a distributed network of Sun SPARCstation 2 workstations; two Intel hypercubes (an iPSC/2 and an iPSC/860); and a Thinking Machines Corporation CM-5, a massively parallel SPMD. This non-conventional 3D wavelet decomposition is very suitable for course-grain implementation on parallel computers with proper load balancing. Close to linear speedup over serial implementations has been achieved using a distributed network. Near-linear speedup was obtained on the hypercubes and the CM-5 for a variety of image-processing applications.}},

An obvious question to ask is “why not use CFD methods to solve aeroacoustics problems?”. Most aerodynamics problems are time independent whereas aeroacoustics problems are, by definition, time dependent. The nature, characteristics and objectives of aeroacoustics problems are also quite different from the commonly encountered CFD problems. There are computational issues that are unique to aeroacoustics. For these reasons computational aeroacoustics requires somewhat independent thinking and development. The objectives of this paper are twofold. First, issues pertinent to aeroacoustics that may or may not be relevant to computational aerodynamics are discussed. The second objective is to review computational methods developed recently which are designed especially for computational aeroacoustics applications. Some of the computational methods to be reviewed are quite different from traditional CFD methods. They should be of interest to the CFD and fluid dynamics communities. © 1995 by C.K.W. Tam.}},

  abstract = {We were requested to predict the future specifications of the electronic materials, electronic packages and micro processors for high performance computer systems going as far out as the year 2000 and beyond. These were to be based on the emerging requirements of the end users. Literature and conferences yielded very little quantitative data. As a result, we understood to design and develop a deterministic and macroscopic model based on physics, math, VLSI design, architecture and integration level considerations. The resulting model transcended the electronic world from system performance to microprocessor description to packaging specifications and required materials specifications. Based on this model, it is likely that the world will see an integration of 100 million transistors on a single chip providing clock frequencies approaching 213 MHz and CPU power near about 238 MIPS. Transportation is a major business for Alcoa. We have used our model to examine what architectural directions the Mobile 2000 would take for satisfying its command and control, navigational, entertainment, communication, engine, transmission and body/cockpit control and management systems. A scenario is developed based on the current and emerging requirements for the above functions leading to the automobile of the year 2000. This is then translated to yield control and system requirements which then are converted to the total computational requirements. The requirements are used to define the future system specifications based on our model's predictions. Alternative architectures are then presented. Cautions and caveats are discussed based on our experience on several large scale Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) networks', design development and implementation. It is imperative to bring the large scale systems thinking to Mobile 2000's automation and support systems so that the classical pitfalls of cost, performance, lack of planning, ad hoc and proliferation of incompatible systems does not take place in this exciting arena.}},

  abstract = {This paper examines the processing of visual information beyond the creation of the early representations. A fundamental requirement at this level is the capacity to establish visually abstract shape properties and spatial relations. This capacity plays a major role in object recognition, visually guided manipulation, and more abstract visual thinking. For the human visual system, the perception of spatial properties and relations that are complex from a computational standpoint nevertheless often appears deceivingly immediate and effortless. The proficiency of the human system in analyzing spatial information far surpasses the capacities of current artificial systems. The study of the computations that underlie this competence may therefore lead to the development of new more efficient methods for the spatial analysis of visual information. The perception of abstract shape properties and spatial relations raises fundamental difficulties with major implications for the overall processing of visual information. It will be argued that the computation of spatial relations divides the analysis of visual information into two main stages. The first is the bottom-up creation of certain representations of the visible environment. The second stage involves the application of process called 'visual routines' to the representations constructed in the first stage. These routines can establish properties and relations that cannot be represented explicitly in the initial representations. Visual routines are composed of sequences of elemental operations. Routines for different properties and relations share elemental operations. Using a fixed set of basic operations, the visual system can assemble different routines to extract an unbounded variety of shape properties and spatial relations. © 1984.}},
