  year = {1998}},
  journal = {SIGPLAN Not.}},
  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a compiler that translates programs written in a type-safe subset of the C programming language into highly optimized DEC Alpha assembly language programs, and a certifier that automatically checks the type safety and memory safety of any assembly language program produced by the compiler. The result of the certifier is either a formal proof of type safety or a counterexample pointing to a potential violation of the type system by the target program. The ensemble of the compiler and the certifier is called a certifying compiler.Several advantages of certifying compilation over previous approaches can be claimed. The notion of a certifying compiler is significantly easier to employ than a formal compiler verification, in part because it is generally easier to verify the correctness of the result of a computation than to prove the correctness of the computation itself. Also, the approach can be applied even to highly optimizing compilers, as demonstrated by the fact that our compiler generates target code, for a range of realistic C programs, which is competitive with both the cc and gcc compilers with all optimizations enabled. The certifier also drastically improves the effectiveness of compiler testing because, for each test case, it statically signals compilation errors that might otherwise require many executions to detect. Finally, this approach is a practical way to produce the safety proofs for a Proof-Carrying Code system, and thus may be useful in a system for safe mobile code.}},

  abstract = {Session types describe structured communication on heterogeneously typed channels at a high level. Their tail-recursive structure imposes a protocol that can be described by a regular language. The types of transmitted values are drawn from the underlying functional language, abstracting from the details of serializing values of structured data types.  Context-free session types extend session types by allowing nested protocols that are not restricted to tail recursion. Nested protocols correspond to deterministic context-free languages. Such protocols are interesting in their own right, but they are particularly suited to describe the low-level serialization of tree-structured data in a type-safe way.  We establish the metatheory of context-free session types, prove that they properly generalize standard (two-party) session types, and take first steps towards type checking by showing that type equivalence is decidable.}},

  abstract = {For a long time it has been argued that the right kind of representation can provide insight and understanding for a problem. Believing in the general hypothesis that the limitations of our thoughts are all too often identical with the limits of our imagination and visualization capabilities, we have developed a Prolog visualization concept based on a module interconnection graph. This approach provides support for the construction of Prolog systems out of modules (programming-in-the-large). In the approach described below we present an integrated Prolog programming environment based on special features of our hypertext system KnowS. Beyond these features are typed links, node classes, and transfer modules allowing dataflow between several components. But a program is not only a static object. To study the details of a program, we really have to see it in operation. Therefore we also provide animation of program execution. We are convinced that our integrated approach of managing sources of different kinds of information, supporting their structuring and the facility to maintain a Prolog program by hypertext nodes and links is an important step to the integration of software engineering environments and hypertext systems.}},

"Gunrock", our graph-processing system, uses a high-level bulk-synchronous abstraction with traversal and computation steps, designed specifically for the GPU. Gunrock couples high performance with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with less than 300 lines of code. We evaluate Gunrock on five graph primitives and show that Gunrock has at least an order of magnitude speedup over Boost and PowerGraph, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives, and better performance than any other GPU high-level graph library.}},

  abstract = {Ideally, a program written as a composition of concise, self-contained components should perform as well as the equivalent hand-written version where the functionality of what was many components has been manually combined into a monolithic implementation. That is, programmers should not have to sacrifice code clarity or good software engineering practices to obtain performance---we want compositionality without a performance penalty. This work shows how to attain this goal for high-level Haskell in the domain of sequence-processing functions, which includes applications such as array processing.Prior work on stream fusion shows how to automatically transform some high-level sequence-processing functions into efficient implementations. It has been used to great effect in Haskell libraries for manipulating byte arrays, Unicode text, and unboxed vectors. However some operations, like vector append, do not perform well within the stream fusion framework. Others, like SIMD computation using the SSE and AVX instructions available on modern x86 chips, do not seem to fit in the stream fusion framework at all. We describe generalized stream fusion, which solves these issues through a careful choice of stream representation. Benchmarks show that high-level Haskell code written using our compiler and libraries can produce code that is faster than both compiler- and hand-vectorized C.}},

This paper establishes a foundation for exploring illusion knitting in the context of computational design and fabrication. We observe that the design space is highly constrained, elucidate these constraints, and derive strategies for developing effective, machine-knittable illusion patterns. We partially automate these strategies in a new interactive design tool that reduces difficult patterning tasks to familiar image editing tasks. Illusion patterns also uncover new fabrication challenges regarding mixed colorwork and texture; we describe new algorithms for mitigating fabrication failures and ensuring high-quality knit results.}},

  abstract = {Mechanical metamaterials enable customizing the elastic properties of physical objects by altering their fine-scale structure. A broad gamut of effective material properties can be produced even from a single fabrication material by optimizing the geometry of a periodic microstructure tiling. Past work has extensively studied the capabilities of microstructures in the small-displacement regime, where periodic homogenization of linear elasticity yields computationally efficient optimal design algorithms. However, many applications involve flexible structures undergoing large deformations for which the accuracy of linear elasticity rapidly deteriorates due to geometric nonlinearities. Design of microstructures at finite strains involves a massive increase in computation and is much less explored; no computational tool yet exists to design metamaterials emulating target hyperelastic laws over finite regions of strain space.We make an initial step in this direction, developing algorithms to accelerate homogenization and metamaterial design for nonlinear elasticity and building a complete framework for the optimal design of planar metamaterials. Our nonlinear homogenization method works by efficiently constructing an accurate interpolant of a microstructure's deformation over a finite space of macroscopic strains likely to be endured by the metamaterial. From this interpolant, the homogenized energy density, stress, and tangent elasticity tensor describing the microstructure's effective properties can be inexpensively computed at any strain. Our design tool then fits the effective material properties to a target constitutive law over a region of strain space using a parametric shape optimization approach, producing a directly manufacturable geometry. We systematically test our framework by designing a catalog of materials fitting isotropic Hooke's laws as closely as possible. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy over traditional linear metamaterial design techniques by fabricating and testing physical prototypes.}},

  abstract = {We present an algorithmic approach to discover, study, and design multistable elastic knots. Elastic knots are physical realizations of closed curves embedded in 3-space. When endowed with the material thickness and bending resistance of a physical wire, these knots settle into equilibrium states that balance the forces induced by elastic deformation and self-contacts of the wire. In general, elastic knots can have many distinct equilibrium states, i.e. they are multistable mechanical systems. We propose a computational pipeline that combines randomized spatial sampling and physics simulation to efficiently find stable equilibrium states of elastic knots. Leveraging results from knot theory, we run our pipeline on thousands of different topological knot types to create an extensive data set of multistable knots. By applying a series of filters to this data, we discover new transformable knots with interesting geometric and physical properties. A further analysis across knot types reveals geometric and topological patterns, yielding constructive principles that generalize beyond the currently tabulated knot types. We show how multistable elastic knots can be used to design novel deployable structures and engaging recreational puzzles. Several physical prototypes at different scales highlight these applications and validate our simulation.}},

  abstract = {Interlocking puzzles are intriguing geometric games where the puzzle pieces are held together based on their geometric arrangement, preventing the puzzle from falling apart. High-level-of-difficulty, or simply high-level, interlocking puzzles are a subclass of interlocking puzzles that require multiple moves to take out the first subassembly from the puzzle. Solving a high-level interlocking puzzle is a challenging task since one has to explore many different configurations of the puzzle pieces until reaching a configuration where the first subassembly can be taken out. Designing a high-level interlocking puzzle with a user-specified level of difficulty is even harder since the puzzle pieces have to be interlocking in all the configurations before the first subassembly is taken out.In this paper, we present a computational approach to design high-level interlocking puzzles. The core idea is to represent all possible configurations of an interlocking puzzle as well as transitions among these configurations using a rooted, undirected graph called a disassembly graph and leverage this graph to find a disassembly plan that requires a minimal number of moves to take out the first subassembly from the puzzle. At the design stage, our algorithm iteratively constructs the geometry of each puzzle piece to expand the disassembly graph incrementally, aiming to achieve a user-specified level of difficulty. We show that our approach allows efficient generation of high-level interlocking puzzles of various shape complexities, including new solutions not attainable by state-of-the-art approaches.}},

  abstract = {Curved folded surfaces, given their ability to produce elegant freeform shapes by folding flat sheets etched with curved creases, hold a special place in computational Origami. Artists and designers have proposed a wide variety of different fold patterns to create a range of interesting surfaces. The creative process, design, as well as fabrication is usually only concerned with the static surface that emerges once folding has completed. Folding such patterns, however, is difficult as multiple creases have to be folded simultaneously to obtain a properly folded target shape. We introduce string actuated curved folded surfaces that can be shaped by pulling a network of strings, thus, vastly simplifying the process of creating such surfaces and making the folding motion an integral part of the design. Technically, we solve the problem of which surface points to string together and how to actuate them by locally expressing a desired folding path in the space of isometric shape deformations in terms of novel string actuation modes. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by computing string actuation networks for a range of well-known crease patterns and testing their effectiveness on physical prototypes.

The entropic regularization term cannot only control spatial regularity of blue noise sampling, but it also reduces conflicts between the desired centroids of Vornoi cells for multi-class sampling. Moreover, the adaptive blue noise property is guaranteed for each individual class, as well as their combined class. Our method can be easily extended to multi-class sampling on a point set surface.

While this problem shares high-level structure with surface-based frame field problems, critical aspects are lost when extending to volumes, while new structure from the flat Euclidean metric emerges. Taking these considerations into account, this article presents an algorithm for computing such “octahedral” fields. Unlike existing approaches, our formulation achieves infinite resolution in the interior of the volume via the boundary element method (BEM), continuously assigning frames to points in the interior from only a triangle mesh discretization of the boundary. The end result is an orthogonal direction field that can be sampled anywhere inside the mesh, with smooth variation and singular structure in the interior, even with a coarse boundary. We illustrate our computed frames on a number of challenging test geometries. Since the octahedral frame field problem is relatively new, we also contribute a thorough discussion of theoretical and practical challenges unique to this problem.}},

As a general solution for commonly manufactured materials, we propose a practical data-driven rendering technique and a measurement approach to efficiently render complex diffraction effects in real time. Our measurement step simply involves photographing a planar diffractive sample illuminated with an LED flash. Here, we directly record the resultant diffraction pattern on the sample surface due to a narrow-band point source illumination. Furthermore, we propose an efficient rendering method that exploits the measurement in conjunction with the Huygens-Fresnel principle to fit relevant diffraction parameters based on a first-order approximation. Our proposed data-driven rendering method requires the precomputation of a single diffraction look-up table for accurate spectral rendering of complex diffraction effects. Second, for sharp specular samples, we propose a novel method for practical measurement of the underlying diffraction grating using out-of-focus “bokeh” photography of the specular highlight. We demonstrate how the measured bokeh can be employed as a height field to drive a diffraction shader based on a first-order approximation for efficient real-time rendering. Finally, we also drive analytic solutions for a few special cases of diffraction from our measurements and demonstrate realistic rendering results under complex light sources and environments.}},

Numerical tests demonstrate that this effectively is a more robust procedure. In particular, when the objects are found in contact, the newly proposed subalgorithm runs from 15\% to 30\% times faster than the original one. The improved performance has a significant impact on various applications, such as real-time simulations and collision avoidance systems. Altogether, the main contributions made to the GJK algorithm are faster convergence rate and reduced computational time. These improvements may be easily added into existing implementations; furthermore, engineering applications that require solutions of distance queries to machine precision can now be tackled using the GJK algorithm.}},

  abstract = {The Laplacian pyramid is ubiquitous for decomposing images into multiple scales and is widely used for image analysis. However, because it is constructed with spatially invariant Gaussian kernels, the Laplacian pyramid is widely believed as being unable to represent edges well and as being ill-suited for edge-aware operations such as edge-preserving smoothing and tone mapping. To tackle these tasks, a wealth of alternative techniques and representations have been proposed, e.g., anisotropic diffusion, neighborhood filtering, and specialized wavelet bases. While these methods have demonstrated successful results, they come at the price of additional complexity, often accompanied by higher computational cost or the need to post-process the generated results. In this paper, we show state-of-the-art edge-aware processing using standard Laplacian pyramids. We characterize edges with a simple threshold on pixel values that allows us to differentiate large-scale edges from small-scale details. Building upon this result, we propose a set of image filters to achieve edge-preserving smoothing, detail enhancement, tone mapping, and inverse tone mapping. The advantage of our approach is its simplicity and flexibility, relying only on simple point-wise nonlinearities and small Gaussian convolutions; no optimization or post-processing is required. As we demonstrate, our method produces consistently high-quality results, without degrading edges or introducing halos.}},

  abstract = {Parametric surfaces are an essential modeling tool in computer aided design and movie production. Even though their use is well established in industry, generating ray-traced images adds significant cost in time and memory consumption. Ray tracing such surfaces is usually accomplished by subdividing the surfaces on the fly, or by conversion to a polygonal representation. However, on-the-fly subdivision is computationally very expensive, whereas polygonal meshes require large amounts of memory. This is a particular problem for parametric surfaces with displacement, where very fine tessellation is required to faithfully represent the shape. Hence, memory restrictions are the major challenge in production rendering. In this article, we present a novel solution to this problem. We propose a compression scheme for a priori Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVHs) on parametric patches, that reduces the data required for the hierarchy by a factor of up to 48. We further propose an approximate evaluation method that does not require leaf geometry, yielding an overall reduction of memory consumption by a factor of 60 over regular BVHs on indexed face sets and by a factor of 16 over established state-of-the-art compression schemes. Alternatively, our compression can simply be applied to a standard BVH while keeping the leaf geometry, resulting in a compression rate of up to 2:1 over current methods. Although decompression generates additional costs during traversal, we can manage very complex scenes even on the memory restrictive GPU at competitive render times.}},

Lines drawn by artists in this study largely overlapped one another (75\% are within 1mm of another line), particularly along the occluding contours of the object. Most lines that do not overlap contours overlap large gradients of the image intensity, and correlate strongly with predictions made by recent line drawing algorithms in computer graphics. 14\% were not well described by any of the local properties considered in this study. The result of our work is a publicly available data set of aligned drawings, an analysis of where lines appear in that data set based on local properties of 3D models, and algorithms to predict where artists will draw lines for new scenes.}},

There are degrees of freedom in this process, such as the starting point of the slicing sequence and the thickness of each slice. The choice of these parameters influences the manufacturing process and its result: The number of slices significantly affects the time needed for manufacturing, while their thickness affects the error. Assuming a discrete setting, we measure the error as the number of voxels that are incorrectly assigned due to slicing. We provide an algorithm that generates, for a given set of available slice heights and a shape, a slicing that is provably optimal. By optimal, we mean that the algorithm generates sequences with minimal error for any possible number of slices. The algorithm is fast and flexible, that is, it can accommodate a user driven importance modulation of the error function and allows the interactive exploration of the desired quality/time tradeoff. We demonstrate the practical importance of our optimization on several three-dimensional-printed results.}},

Body motion is an effective way of portraying different personalities and differentiating characters. The purpose and contribution of this work is to describe a formal, broadly applicable, procedural, and empirically grounded association between personality and body motion and apply this association to modify a given virtual human body animation that can be represented by these formal concepts. Because the body movement of virtual characters may involve different choices of parameter sets depending on the context, situation, or application, formulating a link from personality to body motion requires an intermediate step to assist generalization. For this intermediate step, we refer to Laban Movement Analysis, which is a movement analysis technique for systematically describing and evaluating human motion. We have developed an expressive human motion generation system with the help of movement experts and conducted a user study to explore how the psychologically validated OCEAN personality factors were perceived in motions with various Laban parameters. We have then applied our findings to procedurally animate expressive characters with personality, and validated the generalizability of our approach across different models and animations via another perception study.}},

  abstract = {Real-time, high-quality, 3D scanning of large-scale scenes is key to mixed reality and robotic applications. However, scalability brings challenges of drift in pose estimation, introducing significant errors in the accumulated model. Approaches often require hours of offline processing to globally correct model errors. Recent online methods demonstrate compelling results but suffer from (1) needing minutes to perform online correction, preventing true real-time use; (2) brittle frame-to-frame (or frame-to-model) pose estimation, resulting in many tracking failures; or (3) supporting only unstructured point-based representations, which limit scan quality and applicability. We systematically address these issues with a novel, real-time, end-to-end reconstruction framework. At its core is a robust pose estimation strategy, optimizing per frame for a global set of camera poses by considering the complete history of RGB-D input with an efficient hierarchical approach. We remove the heavy reliance on temporal tracking and continually localize to the globally optimized frames instead. We contribute a parallelizable optimization framework, which employs correspondences based on sparse features and dense geometric and photometric matching. Our approach estimates globally optimized (i.e., bundle adjusted) poses in real time, supports robust tracking with recovery from gross tracking failures (i.e., relocalization), and re-estimates the 3D model in real time to ensure global consistency, all within a single framework. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online systems with quality on par to offline methods, but with unprecedented speed and scan completeness. Our framework leads to a comprehensive online scanning solution for large indoor environments, enabling ease of use and high-quality results.1}},

It follows a three-step pipeline similar to the one proposed by Carrier Baudoin et al.: (1) generate a frame field, (2) generate a pointset P that is mostly organized on a regular grid locally aligned with the frame field, and (3) generate the hexahedral-dominant mesh by recombining the tetrahedra obtained from the constrained Delaunay triangulation of P.For step (1), we use a state-of-the-art algorithm to generate a smooth frame field. For step (2), we introduce an extension of Periodic Global Parameterization to the volumetric case. As compared with other global parameterization methods (such as CubeCover), our method relaxes some global constraints to avoid creating degenerate elements, at the expense of introducing some singularities that are meshed using non-hexahedral elements. For step (3), we build on the formalism introduced by Meshkat and Talmor, fill in a gap in their proof, and provide a complete enumeration of all the possible recombinations, as well as an algorithm that efficiently detects all the matches in a tetrahedral mesh.The method is evaluated and compared with the state of the art on a database of examples with various mesh complexities, varying from academic examples to real industrial cases. Compared with the method of Carrier-Baudoin et al., the method results in better scores for classical quality criteria of hexahedral-dominant meshes (hexahedral proportion, scaled Jacobian, etc.). The method also shows better robustness than CubeCover and its derivatives when applied to complicated industrial models.}},

A four-dimensional holodeck data structure serves as a rendering target and caching mechanism for interactive walk-throughs of nondiffuse environments with full global illumination. Ray sample density varies locally according to need, and on-demand ray computation is supported in a parallel implementation. The holodeck file is stored on disk and cached in memory by a server using a least-recently-used (LRU) beam-replacement strategy. The holodeck server coordinates separate ray evaluation and display processes, optimizing disk and memory usage. Different display systems are supported by specialized drivers, which handle display rendering,  user interaction, and input. The display driver creates an image from ray samples sent by the server and permits the manipulation of local objects, which are rendered dynamically using approximate lighting computed from holodeck samples. The overall method overcomes many of the conventionl limits of interactive rendering in scenes with complex surface geometry and reflectance properties, through an effective combination of ray tracing, caching, and hardware rendering.}},

The formulae allow us to study and design sampling schemes adapted to different classes of integrands by analyzing the effect of sampling density, weighting, and correlations among point locations separately. We then focus on non-adaptive correlated stratified sampling patterns and specialize the formulae to derive closed-form and easy-to-analyze expressions of bias and variance for various stratified sampling strategies. Based on these expressions, we perform a theoretical error analysis for integrands involving the discontinuous visibility function. We show that significant reductions in error can be obtained by considering alternative sampling strategies instead of the commonly used random jittering or low discrepancy patterns. Our theoretical results agree with and extend various previous results, provide a unified analytic treatment of point patterns, and lead to novel insights. We validate the results with extensive experiments on benchmark integrands as well as real scenes with soft shadows.}},

In our benchmark, BSGP programs achieve similar or better performance than well-optimized CUDA programs, while the source code complexity and programming time are significantly reduced.

Our work simplifies this task using a relighting technique that transfers the desired illumination of one portrait onto another. The novelty in our approach to this challenging problem is our formulation of relighting as a mass transport problem. We start from standard color histogram matching that only captures the overall tone of the illumination, and we show how to use the mass-transport formulation to make it dependent on facial geometry. We fit a three-dimensional (3D) morphable face model to the portrait, and for each pixel, we combine the color value with the corresponding 3D position and normal. We then solve a mass-transport problem in this augmented space to generate a color remapping that achieves localized, geometry-aware relighting. Our technique is robust to variations in facial appearance and small errors in face reconstruction. As we demonstrate, this allows our technique to handle a variety of portraits and illumination conditions, including scenarios that are challenging for previous methods.}},

These textures are ubiquitous in numerous applications of computer-aided illustration. Previous methods, whether they be example-based or layout-based, lack control and can produce a limited range of possible arrangements. Our approach targets technical artists who will design an arrangement by writing a script. These scripts are using three types of operators: partitioning operators for defining the broad-scale organization of the arrangement, mapping operators for controlling the local organization of elements, and merging operators for mixing different arrangements. These operators are designed so as to guarantee a stationary result, meaning that the produced arrangements will always be repetitive. We show that this simple set of operators is sufficient to reach a much broader variety of arrangements than previous methods. Editing the script leads to predictable changes in the synthesized arrangement, which allows an easy iterative design of complex structures. Finally, our operator set is extensible and can be adapted to application-dependent needs.}},

  abstract = {The ultimate goal of many image-based modeling systems is to render photo-realistic novel views of a scene without visible artifacts. Existing evaluation metrics and benchmarks focus mainly on the geometric accuracy of the reconstructed model, which is, however, a poor predictor of visual accuracy. Furthermore, using only geometric accuracy by itself does not allow evaluating systems that either lack a geometric scene representation or utilize coarse proxy geometry. Examples include a light field and most image-based rendering systems. We propose a unified evaluation approach based on novel view prediction error that is able to analyze the visual quality of any method that can render novel views from input images. One key advantage of this approach is that it does not require ground truth geometry. This dramatically simplifies the creation of test datasets and benchmarks. It also allows us to evaluate the quality of an unknown scene during the acquisition and reconstruction process, which is useful for acquisition planning. We evaluate our approach on a range of methods, including standard geometry-plus-texture pipelines as well as image-based rendering techniques, compare it to existing geometry-based benchmarks, demonstrate its utility for a range of use cases, and present a new virtual rephotography-based benchmark for image-based modeling and rendering systems.}},

Previous methods such as Position-Based or Projective Dynamics are fast but support only a limited selection of materials; even classical materials such as the Neo-Hookean elasticity are not supported. Recently, Xu et al. [2015] introduced new “spline-based materials” that can be easily controlled by artists to achieve desired animation effects. Simulation of these types of materials currently relies on Newton’s method, which is slow, even with only one iteration per timestep. In this article, we show that Projective Dynamics can be interpreted as a quasi-Newton method. This insight enables very efficient simulation of a large class of hyperelastic materials, including the Neo-Hookean, spline-based materials, and others. The quasi-Newton interpretation also allows us to leverage ideas from numerical optimization. In particular, we show that our solver can be further accelerated using L-BFGS updates (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm). Our final method is typically more than 10 times faster than one iteration of Newton’s method without compromising quality. In fact, our result is often more accurate than the result obtained with one iteration of Newton’s method. Our method is also easier to implement, implying reduced software development costs.}},

This approach gains stability and robustness by estimating the camera, scene geometry, and light sources in sequence and by using a confidence map, which is a per-pixel weight map. The results of our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can estimate a scene accurately enough for realistic relighting of images. Moreover, the experimental results of our user studies show that the synthesized images are so realistic as to be almost indistinguishable from real photographs.}},

Our goal is to translate high-level style descriptions, such as “Ming” or “European” for furniture models, into explicit and localized regions over the geometric models that characterize each style. For each style, the set of style-defining elements is defined as the union of all the elements that are able to discriminate the style. Another property of the style-defining elements is that they are frequently occurring, reflecting shape characteristics that appear across multiple shapes of the same style. Given an input set of 3D shapes spanning multiple categories and styles, where the shapes are grouped according to their style labels, we perform a cross-category co-analysis of the shape set to learn and spatially locate a set of defining elements for each style. This is accomplished by first sampling a large number of candidate geometric elements and then iteratively applying feature selection to the candidates, to extract style-discriminating elements until no additional elements can be found. Thus, for each style label, we obtain sets of discriminative elements that together form the superset of defining elements for the style. We demonstrate that the co-location of style-defining elements allows us to solve problems such as style classification, and enables a variety of applications such as style-revealing view selection, style-aware sampling, and style-driven modeling for 3D shapes.}},

  abstract = {Content replication and name-based routing lead to a natural multi-source and multipath transmission paradigm in NDN. Due to the unique connectionless characteristic of NDN, current end-to-end multipath congestion control schemes (e.g. MPTCP) cannot be used directly on NDN. This paper proposes a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) model to formulate multi-source and multipath transmission in NDN with in-network caches. From this model, a family of receiver-driven transmission solutions can be derived, named as path-specified congestion control. The path-specified congestion control enables content consumers to separate the traffic control on each path, which consequently facilitates fair and efficient bandwidth sharing amongst all consumers. As a specific instance, a Delay-based Path-specified Congestion Control Protocol (DPCCP) is presented, which utilizes queuing delays as signals to measure and control congestion levels of different bottlenecks. In addition, a set of high-performance congestion control laws are designed to accelerate bandwidth and fairness convergence towards the optimum defined by the NUM model. Finally, DPCCP is compared with state-of-the-art solutions. The experimental evaluations show that DPCCP outperforms existing solutions in terms of bandwidth utilization, convergence time and packet loss.}},

  abstract = {Driven by the dominance of the relational model, the requirements of modern applications, and the veracity of data, we revisit the fundamental notion of a key in relational databases with NULLs. In SQL database systems primary key columns are NOT NULL by default. NULL columns may occur in unique constraints which only guarantee uniqueness for tuples which do not feature null markers in any of the columns involved, and therefore serve a different function than primary keys. We investigate the notions of possible and certain keys, which are keys that hold in some or all possible worlds that can originate from an SQL table, respectively. Possible keys coincide with the unique constraint of SQL, and thus provide a semantics for their syntactic definition in the SQL standard. Certain keys extend primary keys to include NULL columns, and thus form a sufficient and necessary condition to identify tuples uniquely, while primary keys are only sufficient for that purpose. In addition to basic characterization, axiomatization, and simple discovery approaches for possible and certain keys, we investigate the existence and construction of Armstrong tables, and describe an indexing scheme for enforcing certain keys. Our experiments show that certain keys with NULLs do occur in real-world databases, and that related computational problems can be solved efficiently. Certain keys are therefore semantically well-founded and able to maintain data quality in the form of Codd's entity integrity rule while handling the requirements of modern applications, that is, higher volumes of incomplete data from different formats.}},

Approximate query processing (AQP) attempts to tackle this problem and allows systems to return query results at "human speed." However, existing AQP techniques start to break down when confronted with ad hoc queries that target the tails of the distribution.We therefore present an AQP formulation that can provide low-error approximate results at interactive speeds, even for queries over rare subpopulations. In particular, our formulation treats query results as random variables in order to leverage the ample opportunities for result reuse inherent in interactive data exploration. As part of our approach, we apply a variety of optimization techniques that are based on probability theory, including new query rewrite rules and index structures. We implemented these techniques in a prototype system and show that they can achieve interactivity where alternative approaches cannot.}},

  abstract = {An important step in data preparation involves dealing with incomplete datasets. In some cases, the missing values are unreported because they are characteristics of the domain and are known by practitioners. Due to this nature of the missing values, imputation and inference methods do not work and input from domain experts is required. A common method for experts to fill missing values is through rules. However, for large datasets with thousands of missing data points, it is laborious and time consuming for a user to make sense of the data and formulate effective completion rules. Thus, users need to be shown subsets of the data that will have the most impact in completing missing fields. Further, these subsets should provide the user with enough information to make an update. Choosing subsets that maximize the probability of filling in missing data from a large dataset is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we present Icarus, which uses a heuristic algorithm to show the user small subsets of the database in the form of a matrix. This allows the user to iteratively fill in data by applying suggested rules based on their direct edits to the matrix. The suggested rules amplify the users' input to multiple missing fields by using the database schema to infer hierarchies. Simulations show Icarus has an average improvement of 50\% across three datasets over the baseline system. Further, in-person user studies demonstrate that naive users can fill in 68\% of missing data within an hour, while manual rule specification spans weeks.}},

However, until today it is not clear which paradigm yields faster query execution, as many implementation-specific choices obstruct a direct comparison of architectures. In this paper, we experimentally compare the two models by implementing both within the same test system. This allows us to use for both models the same query processing algorithms, the same data structures, and the same parallelization framework to ultimately create an apples-to-apples comparison. We find that both are efficient, but have different strengths and weaknesses. Vectorization is better at hiding cache miss latency, whereas data-centric compilation requires fewer CPU instructions, which benefits cache-resident workloads. Besides raw, single-threaded performance, we also investigate SIMD as well as multi-core parallelization and different hardware architectures. Finally, we analyze qualitative differences as a guide for system architects.}},

  abstract = {Data lineage describes the relationship between individual input and output data items of a workflow and is an integral ingredient for both traditional (e.g., debugging or auditing) and emergent (e.g., explanations or cleaning) applications. The core, long-standing problem that lineage systems need to address---and the main focus of this paper---is to quickly capture lineage across a workflow in order to speed up future queries over lineage. Current lineage systems, however, either incur high lineage capture overheads, high lineage query processing costs, or both. In response, developers resort to manual implementations of applications that, in principal, can be expressed and optimized in lineage terms. This paper describes Smoke, an in-memory database engine that provides both fast lineage capture and lineage query processing. To do so, Smoke tightly integrates the lineage capture logic into physical database operators; stores lineage in efficient lineage representations; and employs optimizations if future lineage queries are known up-front. Our experiments on microbenchmarks and realistic workloads show that Smoke reduces the lineage capture overhead and lineage query costs by multiple orders of magnitude as compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. On real-world applications, we show that Smoke meets the latency requirements of interactive visualizations (e.g., < 150ms) and outperforms hand-written implementations of data profiling primitives.}},

  abstract = {To address the classical selectivity estimation problem in database systems, a radically different query processing technique called PlanBouquet was proposed in 2014. In this approach, the estimation process is completely abandoned and replaced with a calibrated selectivity discovery mechanism. The beneficial outcome is that provable guarantees are obtained on worst-case execution performance, thereby facilitating robust query processing. An improved version of PlanBouquet, called SpillBound (SB), which significantly accelerates the selectivity discovery process, and provides platform-independent performance guarantees, was presented two years ago.Notwithstanding its benefits, a limitation of SpillBound is that its guarantees are predicated on expending enormous preprocessing efforts during query compilation, making it suitable only for canned queries that are invoked repeatedly. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the fact that plan cost functions typically exhibit concave down behavior with regard to predicate selectivities. Specifically, we design FrugalSpillBound, which provably achieves extremely attractive tradeoffs between the performance guarantees and the compilation overheads. For instance, relaxing the performance guarantee by a factor of two typically results in at least two orders of magnitude reduction in the overheads. Further, when empirically evaluated on benchmark OLAP queries, the decrease in overheads is even greater, often more than three orders of magnitude. Therefore, FrugalSpillBound substantively extends robust query processing towards supporting ad-hoc queries.}},

We present a comprehensive suite of techniques for solving this problem, ranging from exact algorithms where k is fixed in advance, to approximate methods that work for any k and are able to exploit workload and data characteristics to improve accuracy while capping index cost.

Our technique avoids computing the exact distance between two tree objects, if the objects do not share at least one common subgraph. In order to scale up the join, the computed subgraphs are managed in a two-layer index.

  abstract = {Many modern applications produce massive amounts of data series that need to be analyzed, requiring efficient similarity search operations. However, the state-of-the-art data series indexes that are used for this purpose do not scale well for massive datasets in terms of performance, or storage costs. We pinpoint the problem to the fact that existing summarizations of data series used for indexing cannot be sorted while keeping similar data series close to each other in the sorted order. This leads to two design problems. First, traditional bulk-loading algorithms based on sorting cannot be used. Instead, index construction takes place through slow top-down insertions, which create a non-contiguous index that results in many random I/Os. Second, data series cannot be sorted and split across nodes evenly based on their median value; thus, most leaf nodes are in practice nearly empty. This further slows down query speed and amplifies storage costs. To address these problems, we present Coconut. The first innovation in Coconut is an inverted, sortable data series summarization that organizes data series based on a z-order curve, keeping similar series close to each other in the sorted order. As a result, Coconut is able to use bulk-loading techniques that rely on sorting to quickly build a contiguous index using large sequential disk I/Os. We then explore prefix-based and median-based splitting policies for bottom-up bulk-loading, showing that median-based splitting outperforms the state of the art, ensuring that all nodes are densely populated. Overall, we show analytically and empirically that Coconut dominates the state-of-the-art data series indexes in terms of construction speed, query speed, and storage costs.}},

In this paper, however, we show that the lock scheduling choices have significant ramifications on the overall performance of a transactional system. Despite the large body of research on job scheduling outside the database context, lock scheduling presents subtle but challenging requirements that render existing results on scheduling inapt for a transactional database. By carefully studying this problem, we present the concept of contention-aware scheduling, show the hardness of the problem, and propose novel lock scheduling algorithms (LDSF and bLDSF), which guarantee a constant factor approximation of the best scheduling. We conduct extensive experiments using a popular database on both TPC-C and a microbenchmark. Compared to FIFO---the default scheduler in most database systems---our bLDSF algorithm yields up to 300x speedup in overall transaction latency. Alternatively, our LDSF algorithm, which is simpler and achieves comparable performance to bLDSF, has already been adopted by open-source community, and was chosen as the default scheduling strategy in MySQL 8.0.3+}},

This calls for a framework for efficiently processing RDF data. The core function of processing RDF data is subgraph pattern matching. There have been two completely different directions for supporting efficient subgraph pattern matching. One direction is to develop specialized RDF query processing engines exploiting the properties of RDF data for the last decade, while the other direction is to develop efficient subgraph isomorphism algorithms for general, labeled graphs for over 30 years. Although both directions have a similar goal (i.e., finding subgraphs in data graphs for a given query graph), they have been independently researched without clear reason. We argue that a subgraph isomorphism algorithm can be easily modified to handle the graph homomorphism, which is the RDF pattern matching semantics, by just removing the injectivity constraint. In this paper, based on the state-of-the-art subgraph isomorphism algorithm, we propose an in-memory solution, TurboHOM++, which is tamed for the RDF processing, and we compare it with the representative RDF processing engines for several RDF benchmarks in a server machine where billions of triples can be loaded in memory. In order to speed up TurboHOM++, we also provide a simple yet effective transformation and a series of optimization techniques. Extensive experiments using several RDF benchmarks show that TurboHOM++ consistently and significantly outperforms the representative RDF engines.

Since permutation test is computationally expensive, two effective pruning strategies are developed to reduce the computation time. Furthermore, we show how the proposed method can be extended to efficiently answer the classic threshold query: given an object, retrieve all the objects in the database that have relationships, whose significance values are above certain threshold, with the query object. Empirical studies on both synthetic data and real movement data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.}},

We use sophisticated composition methods, namely uni- and bi-directional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short term memory (LSTM) hidden units, to convert each tuple to a distributed representation (i.e., a vector), which can in turn be used to effectively capture similarities between tuples. We consider both the case where pre-trained word embeddings are available as well the case where they are not; we present ways to learn and tune the distributed representations that are customized for a specific ER task under different scenarios. We propose a locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based blocking approach that takes all attributes of a tuple into consideration and produces much smaller blocks, compared with traditional methods that consider only a few attributes.

  abstract = {We present ease.ml, a declarative machine learning service platform. With ease.ml, a user defines the high-level schema of an ML application and submits the task via a Web interface. The system then deals with the rest, such as model selection and data movement. The ultimate question we hope to understand is that, as a "service provider" that manages a shared cluster of machines running machine learning workloads, what is the resource sharing strategy that maximizes the global satisfaction of all our users?This paper does not completely answer this general question, but focuses on solving the first technical challenge we were facing when trying to build ease.ml. We observe that resource sharing is a critical yet subtle issue in this multi-tenant scenario, as we have to balance between efficiency and fairness. We first formalize the problem that we call multi-tenant model selection, aiming for minimizing the total regret of all users running automatic model selection tasks. We then develop a novel algorithm that combines multi-armed bandits with Bayesian optimization and prove a regret bound under the multi-tenant setting. Finally, we report our evaluation of ease.ml on synthetic data and on two services we are providing to our users, namely, image classification with deep neural networks and binary classification with Azure ML Studio. Our experimental evaluation results show that our proposed solution can be up to 9.8x faster in achieving the same global average accuracy for all users as the two popular heuristics used by our users before ease.ml, and 4.1 x faster than state-of-the-art systems.}},

  abstract = {This paper introduces DIAMetrics: a novel framework for end-to-end benchmarking and performance monitoring of query engines. DIAMetrics consists of a number of components supporting tasks such as automated workload summarization, data anonymization, benchmark execution, monitoring, regression identification, and alerting. The architecture of DIAMetrics is highly modular and supports multiple systems by abstracting their implementation details and relying on common canonical formats and pluggable software drivers. The end result is a powerful unified framework that is capable of supporting every aspect of benchmarking production systems and workloads. DIAMetrics has been developed in Google and is being used to benchmark a number of internal query engines. In this paper, we give an overview of DIAMetrics and discuss its design and implementation. Furthermore, we provide details about its deployment and example use cases. Given the variety of supported systems and use cases within Google, we argue that its core concepts can be used more widely to enable comparative end-to-end benchmarking in other industrial environments.}},

  abstract = {This paper proposes to deduce certain fixes to graphs G based on data quality rules Σ and ground truth Γ (i.e., validated attribute values and entity matches). We fix errors detected by Σ in G such that the fixes are assured correct as long as Σand Γ are correct. We deduce certain fixes in two paradigms. (a) We interact with users and "incrementally" fix errors online. Whenever users pick a small set V0 of nodes in G, we fix all errors pertaining to V0 and accumulate ground truth in the process. (b) Based on accumulated Γ, we repair the entire graph G offline; while this may not correct all errors in G, all fixes are guaranteed certain.We develop techniques for deducing certain fixes. (1) We define data quality rules to support conditional functional dependencies, recursively defined keys and negative rules on graphs, such that we can deduce fixes by combining data repairing and object identification. (2) We show that deducing certain fixes is Church-Rosser, i.e., the deduction converges at the same fixes regardless of the order of rules applied. (3) We establish the complexity of three fundamental problems associated with certain fixes. (4) We provide (parallel) algorithms for deducing certain fixes online and offline, and guarantee to reduce running time when given more processors. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of our methods.}},

  journal = {Proc. VLDB Endow.}},
  abstract = {In interaction networks nodes may interact continuously and repeatedly. Not only which nodes interact is important, but also the order in which interactions take place and the patterns they form. These patterns cannot be captured by solely inspecting the static network of who interacted with whom and how frequently, but also the temporal nature of the network needs to be taken into account. In this paper we focus on one such fundamental interaction pattern, namely a temporal cycle. Temporal cycles have many applications and appear naturally in communication networks. In financial networks, on the other hand, the presence of a temporal cycle could be indicative for certain types of fraud, and in biological networks, feedback loops are a prime example of this pattern type. We present 2SCENT, an efficient algorithms to find all temporal cycles in a directed interaction network. 2SCENT consist of a non-trivial temporal extension of a seminal algorithm for finding cycles in static graphs, preceded by an efficient candidate root filtering technique which can be based on Bloom filters to reduce the memory footprint. We tested 2SCENT on six real-world data sets, showing that it is up to 300 times faster than the only existing competitor and scales up to networks with millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of interactions. Results of a qualitative experiment indicate that different interaction networks may have vastly different distributions of temporal cycles, and hence temporal cycles are able to characterize an important aspect of the dynamic behavior in the networks.}},

Despite the fact that data series indexes enable fast similarity search, all existing indexes can only answer queries of a single length (fixed at index construction time), which is a severe limitation. In this work, we propose ULISSE, the first data series index structure designed for answering similarity search queries of variable length. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce a novel representation technique, which effectively and succinctly summarizes multiple sequences of different length (irrespective of Z-normalization). Based on the proposed index, we describe efficient algorithms for approximate and exact similarity search, combining disk based index visits and in-memory sequential scans. We experimentally evaluate our approach using several synthetic and real datasets. The results show that ULISSE is several times (and up to orders of magnitude) more efficient in terms of both space and time cost, when compared to competing approaches.}},

  abstract = {As a general abstraction for coordinating the distributed storage and access of model parameters, the parameter server (PS) architecture enables distributed machine learning to handle large datasets and high dimensional models. Many systems, such as Parameter Server and Petuum, have been developed based on the PS architecture and widely used in practice. However, none of these systems supports changing parallelism during runtime, which is crucial for the efficient execution of machine learning tasks with dynamic workloads. We propose a new system, called FlexPS, which introduces a novel multi-stage abstraction to support flexible parallelism control. With the multi-stage abstraction, a machine learning task can be mapped to a series of stages and the parallelism for a stage can be set according to its workload. Optimizations such as stage scheduler, stage-aware consistency controller, and direct model transfer are proposed for the efficiency of multi-stage machine learning in FlexPS. As a general and complete PS systems, FlexPS also incorporates many optimizations that are not limited to multi-stage machine learning. We conduct extensive experiments using a variety of machine learning workloads, showing that FlexPS achieves significant speedups and resource saving compared with the state-of-the-art PS systems such as Petuum and Multiverso.}},

  abstract = {Background: Integrating computational thinking (CT) into STEM education has recently drawn significant attention, strengthened by the premise that CT and STEM are mutually reinforcing. Previous CT-STEM studies have examined theoretical interpretations, instructional strategies, and assessment targets. However, few have endeavored to delineate the transfer effects of CT-STEM on the development of cognitive and noncognitive benefits. Given this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to provide deeper insights. Results: We analyzed results from 37 studies involving 7,832 students with 96 effect sizes. Our key findings include: (i) identification of 36 benefits; (ii) a moderate overall transfer effect, with moderate effects also observed for both near and far transfers; (iii) a stronger effect on cognitive benefits compared to noncognitive benefits, regardless of the transfer type; (iv) significant moderation by educational level, sample size, instructional strategies, and intervention duration on overall and near-transfer effects, with only educational level and sample size being significant moderators for far-transfer effects. Conclusions: This study analyzes the cognitive and noncognitive benefits arising from CT-STEM’s transfer effects, providing new insights to foster more effective STEM classroom teaching. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {Addressing cognitive disparities has become a paramount concern in computational thinking (CT) education. The intricate and nuanced relationships between CT and cognitive variations emphasize the needs to accommodate diverse cognitive profiles when fostering CT skills, recognizing that these cognitive functions can manifest as either strengths or limitations in different students. Consequently, understanding the connections between students’ cognitive functions and CT skills assumes pivotal importance in the design of personalized instructional strategies for CT. Despite a general consideration of learning variability in CT education, empirical insights exploring the correlation between cognitive skills and CT competencies remain notably scarce. This study endeavors to bridge this research gap by investigating the links between executive functions and CT skills, as well as the associations between their sub-dimensions. The results reveal a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.452 between these two domains, underscoring the notable connection between executive functions and CT abilities. Furthermore, the sub-dimensional analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of how specific executive functions uniquely contribute to certain CT skills. In light of these findings, this research offers a promising pathway for the development of tailored CT education programs that can cater to the unique needs of each individual, ultimately facilitating inclusive CT programs and making significant contributions to broaden STEM education and future workforce. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

This study seeks to fill this gap by employing gamified CT items across multiple difficulty levels to calculate comprehensive behavioral sequence quality indicators. And then, through latent profile analysis, we identified four distinct latent classes of behavioral process. We then examined the in-game performance differences among these classes, uncovering each class’s unique attributes. Class 1 students consistently demonstrated high-quality, efficient behavioral sequences regardless of item difficulty. In contrast, class 2 students applied significant cognitive effort and trial-and-error strategies, achieving acceptable scores despite low behavioral sequence quality. Class 3 students excelled in simpler items but faltered with more complex ones. Class 4 students displayed low motivation for challenging items, often guessing answers quickly. Additionally, we investigated the predictive value of students’ performance in gamified items and their behavioral process classes for their external CT test scores. The study finally elaborated on the theoretical implications for researchers and the practical suggestions for teachers in CT cultivation. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {In the past decade, Computational Thinking (CT) education has received growing attention from researchers. Although many reviews have provided synthesized information on CT teaching and learning, few have paid particular attention to collaborative learning (CL) strategies. CL has been widely implemented in CT classes and has become the most popular pedagogy among educators. Therefore, a systematic review of CL in CT classes would provide practical guidance on teaching strategies to enhance CT interventions and improve the quality of teaching and learning, ultimately benefiting students’ CT skills development. To address this gap, this study examined 43 empirical studies that have applied CL strategies, ranging from 2006 to 2022. Several findings were revealed in the analysis. First, a wide range of theories and frameworks were applied to inform research questions, pedagogical design, and research methodologies. Second, despite the acknowledged importance of group composition in effective CL, a large number of studies did not provide details on how the students were grouped. Third, six types of CL activities and instructional designs have been identified in CT classrooms. The synthesized information provides valuable insights that can inform future research directions and guide the design and implementation of CL activities in future CT classes. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {This research aimed to investigate the structural relationships among teachers’ computational thinking (CT), design thinking (DT), robotics teaching beliefs, and robotics pedagogical content knowledge (RPCK). A total of 98 in-service and pre-service teachers who participated in a robotics teaching professional development workshop served as the sample of the study. A survey including the Computational Thinking Scale, the Design Thinking Disposition Scale, the Robotics Teaching Beliefs Scale and the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge–Robotics Scale was conducted after the workshop. A confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the measurement constructs, and Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was utilized to examine the relationships among the factors. The results revealed that both CT and DT dispositions could positively predict teachers’ robotics teaching beliefs, which subsequently predicted their RPCK. Moreover, a direct positive relationship between CT and RPCK was identified, while such a relationship was not evident for DT. The model demonstrates the critical role of CT in shaping teachers' beliefs and pedagogical strategies of robotics teaching, and provides insights into the indirect influence of DT. Finally, the Model of Robotics Teaching Professional Development (MRTPD) was proposed to profile how to promote teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge of robotics teaching from their CT and DT dispositions. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {A growing body of research is focusing on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and computational thinking (CT) to enhance student learning outcomes. Many researchers have designed instructional activities to achieve various learning goals within this field. Despite the prevalence of studies focusing on instructional design and student learning outcomes, how instructional efforts result in the integration of AI and CT in students’ learning processes remains unclear. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies that have integrated AI and CT for student development. We collected 18 papers from four prominent research databases in the fields of education and AI technology: Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and ACM. We coded the collected studies, highlighting the students’ learning processes in terms of research methodology and context, learning tools and instructional design, student learning outcomes, and the interaction between AI and CT. The integration of AI and CT occurs in two ways: the integration of disciplinary knowledge and leveraging AI tools to learn CT. Specifically, we discovered that AI- and CT-related tools, projects, and problems facilitated student-centered instructional designs, resulting in productive AI and CT learning outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {Background: Computational thinking (CT) is crucial to fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Many elementary schools have been cultivating students’ CT through block-based programming languages such as Scratch using traditional teacher-centered teaching methods. However, the approach excessively relies on teacher lectures, so the teacher’s teaching load is hefty, and most students cannot receive timely assistance from teachers, thus reducing students’ programming learning performance, interest, and confidence. Therefore, this study designs a Jigsaw collaborative learning method implemented in a metaverse virtual space (JCLM-MVS) for peer-to-peer Scratch programming learning to promote learners’ programming learning performance, CT, and learning attitudes. This study used a quasi-experimental research method, with 48 fifth-grade students from two classes in Taiwan’s elementary school as the research participants. One class of 24 students was randomly assigned to the experimental group using JCLM-MVS to conduct Scratch programming learning, whereas the other class of 24 students was assigned to the control group using the traditional teacher-centered teaching method. Main findings: The study found that the experimental group of learners showed significantly better Scratch programming learning performance and attitude than the control group, and there was no statistically significant difference in CT between both groups, but both learning approaches effectively promoted CT. Additionally, the interview results showed that most interviewees stated that using JCLM-MVS for Scratch programming learning could receive timely assistance from peers, make collaborative learning more efficient and learning more enjoyable, and more intend to use JCLM-MVS for Scratch programming learning than using traditional teacher-centered teaching method due to the effective collaborative interaction mechanisms and realistic learning space provided in the metaverse virtual space. Conclusions/potential implications: This study presents a novel and engaging learning approach by integrating a metaverse virtual space with the Jigsaw collaborative learning method, referred to as JCLM-MVS, which enhances the effectiveness of the Jigsaw collaborative learning method in promoting Scratch programming learning performance, CT, and attitudes. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  title = {Exploring Gender Differences in Computational Thinking Among K-12 Students: A Meta-Analysis Investigating Influential Factors}},
  author = {Hu L.}},
  year = {2024}},
  journal = {Journal of Educational Computing Research}},
  abstract = {This study employs meta-analysis to synthesize findings from 30 articles investigating gender differences in computational thinking (CT) among K-12 students. Encompassing 51 independent effect sizes, the meta-analysis involves a participant pool of 9181 individuals from various countries, comprising 4254 males and 4927 females. Results indicate statistically significant gender differences in CT (Hedges’s g = 0.091, p <.05), albeit with a modest effect size, revealing higher CT scores among males compared to females. Further moderation analyses unveil the multifaceted nature of these gender differences. Specifically, while gender differences become significant during high school, recent studies suggest a gradual reduction in CT gender differences with societal progress among K-12 students. Moreover, findings illustrate variations in gender differences across geographical regions. Notably, while the overall gender disparity in CT is non-significant in the “East Asia and Pacific” region, it widens in “North America” and “Europe”, with males scoring higher than females. Conversely, in “Europe and Central Asia”, such gender differences present inconsistent outcomes, with females scoring higher than males. Importantly, assessment tool type does not significantly influence gender differences. Lastly, this study offers recommendations to address CT gender gaps, providing valuable insights for promoting gender equality in education. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to address two main objectives: (a) the effectiveness of empirical interventions on the development of CT in children aged of 3–8 years; and (b) the variables that influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Following PRISMA procedures, we identified 17 empirical studies with 34 effect sizes and 1665 participants meeting the inclusion criteria from Web of Science database. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (d =.83 [95% CI: 730,.890]; p <.001) on the CT development of 3–8 years old children, which provides empirical support for having young children to engage in CT experiences. The effect size was significantly influenced by moderating variables including gender, scaffolding, and education level. Intervention length showed a marginally significant effect. Therefore, educators could refer to the significant moderators when designing tailored interventions for CT development in early childhood education while a call for more empirical studies of CT development in young children is proposed. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

Although previous research has highlighted potentials of applying educational robotics in STEM education, there is a lack of empirical evidence to investigate and understand the overall effects of using educational robotics in STEM education as well as the critical factors that influence the effects. To fill this gap, this research conducted a multilevel meta-analysis to examine the overall effect size of using educational robotics in STEM education under K-16 education based on 30 effect sizes from 21 studies published between 2010 and 2022. Furthermore, we examined the possible moderator variables of robot-assisted STEM education, including discipline, educational level, instructor support, instructional strategy, interactive type, intervention duration, robotic type, and control group condition. Results showed that educational robotics had the moderate-sized effects on students’ STEM learning compared to the non-robotics condition. Specifically, educational robotics had moderate-sized effects on students’ learning performances and learning attitudes, and insignificant effects on the improvement of computational thinking. Furthermore, we examined the influence of moderator variables in robot-assisted STEM education. Results indicated that the moderator variable of discipline was significantly associated with the effects of educational robotics on STEM learning. Based on the findings, educational and technological implications were provided to guide future research and practice in the application of educational robotics in STEM education. © 2024, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {Algebraic laws of functions in mathematics - such as commutativity, associativity, and idempotence - are often used as the basis to derive more sophisticated properties of complex mathematical structures and are heavily used in abstract computational thinking. Algebraic laws of functions in coding, however, are rarely considered. Yet, they are essential. For example, commutativity and associativity are crucial to ensure correctness of a variety of software systems in numerous domains, such as compiler optimization, big data processing, data flow processing, machine learning or distributed algorithms and data structures. Still, most programming languages lack built-in mechanisms to enforce and verify that operations adhere to such properties. In this paper, we propose a verifier specialized on a set of fundamental algebraic laws that ensures that such laws hold in application code. The verifier can conjecture auxiliary properties and can reason about both equalities and inequalities of expressions, which is crucial to prove a given property when other competitors do not succeed. We implement these ideas in the Propel verifier. Our evaluation against five state-of-the-art verifiers on a total of 142 instances of algebraic properties shows that Propel is able to automatically deduce algebraic properties in different domains that rely on such properties for correctness, even in cases where competitors fail to verify the same properties or time out.  © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved. The design-based STEM + VR teaching case provided in this study is expected to provide some reference for the use of virtual reality courses to cultivate computational thinking in college education.  © 2024 ACM.}},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study about the mapping of the EUDability of End-User Development (EUD) tools with the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users. This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain. © 2024 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is essential for developing creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence in the 21st century. Coding tools like robotic toys and tablet apps have become popular in early childhood education to support CT development, but there is a debate on which tool is more effective. Little evidence exists on the effect of coding on children’s Social-Emotional Competence (SEC), which is crucial for lifelong development and extends beyond cognitive development. This experimental study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two 9-week programs on promoting 73 preschool children’s CT and SEC, one using coding robots and the other using coding apps. The results showed that children who participated in the Coding Robot Program had higher CT scores than those in the Coding App Program, after controlling for age, gender, family socioeconomic status, and baseline CT scores. While the SEC scores showed no substantial disparities between the groups, it was revealed that the initial performance levels moderated the intervention effects on emotional regulation and overall SEC. This suggests that the Coding Robot Program could be especially advantageous for a subset of children who initially have difficulties with emotional regulation and social skills. Implications of this study are presented for research and practice. © The Author(s) 2024.}},

  abstract = {Given the importance of the introductory programming course (CS1), the Computer Science Education community has devoted a significant effort to generate empirical evidence and propose tools, techniques, and curricular approaches to support students. For instance, Parsons Problems have emerged as one of the preferred scaffolding strategies to help CS1 students get a grasp on programming before being exposed to open write-code assignments. However, prior literature has not given enough attention to those students who fail CS1 and must retake the course. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory case study aimed at understanding the effectiveness of Parsons Problems as an active scaffolding strategy delivered to CS1 retakers at the University of Chile. In this version of the course, although students were already introduced to computational thinking, program design, and coding (as they were taking CS1 for a second time), it was the first time they were exposed to Parsons Problems. We conducted a follow-up assessment of the students' perceptions throughout the course, employing a combination of focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and end-course surveys. Our results suggest that Parsons Problems are effective for learners beyond the ''novice programmer'' stage (such as the experience of CS1 retakers), highlighting good practices to support the studied group in terms of engagement, performance, and overall student experience. © 2024 ACM.}},

We, therefore, conducted a DT activity focusing on coding engaging 33 children (aged 10 to 12) and analysed measurements including learning gain (from knowledge tests) and behavioural and affective states (from physiological sensors, video and voice recordings). Our results show that engagement and confusion exhibit positive correlations between MMD measurements and learning gain, while stress, frustration and anger stand out as detrimental for it.

  abstract = {Programming courses can be challenging for first year university students, especially for those without prior coding experience. Students initially struggle with code syntax, but as more advanced topics are introduced across a semester, the difficulty in learning to program shifts to learning computational thinking (e.g., debugging strategies). This study examined the relationships between students' rate of programming errors and their grades on two exams. Using an online integrated development environment, data were collected from 280 students in a Java programming course. The course had two parts. The first focused on introductory procedural programming and culminated with exam 1, while the second part covered more complex topics and object-oriented programming and ended with exam 2. To measure students' programming abilities, 51095 code snapshots were collected from students while they completed assignments that were autograded based on unit tests. Compiler and runtime errors were extracted from the snapshots, and three measures - Error Count, Error Quotient and Repeated Error Density - were explored to identify the best measure explaining variability in exam grades. Models utilizing Error Quotient outperformed the models using the other two measures, in terms of the explained variability in grades and Bayesian Information Criterion. Compiler errors were significant predictors of exam 1 grades but not exam 2 grades; only runtime errors significantly predicted exam 2 grades. The findings indicate that leveraging Error Quotient with multiple error types (compiler and runtime) may be a better measure of students' introductory programming abilities, though still not explaining most of the observed variability. © 2024 ACM.}},

  abstract = {With the growing demand for computational skills in the job market, it’s imperative that lower secondary school students grasp basic programming concepts such as repetition, modularity, conditionals, and variables. Yet, many students perceive computer science as daunting and irrelevant. Physical computing offers a promising solution to this motivational gap. It enhances intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes towards technology. Moreover, they engage students who may not identify as typical programmers and foster essential computational thinking skills. This research investigates the efficacy of employing the same educational robot in different contexts, such as music, images, colors, and simple video games, while teaching basic programming concepts. We call this approach “multi-context physical computing” to emphasize the focus on the different application scenarios. We believe that this could benefit students for two reasons. Firstly, by presenting the same concept across different contexts, learners can better grasp the essence of the concept, disentangling it from extraneous contextual associations. Secondly, catering to individual interests by offering diverse contexts may enhance motivation, consequently fostering improved learning outcomes, as predicted by the expectancy-value theory. In order to assess the benefits of the multi-context approach on learning outcomes and motivation, we will compare it to a more traditional single-context approach centered on robot locomotion in a randomized controlled study. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)}},

  abstract = {The premise for the development of the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course was aimed at broadening participation in computing, as a high school level CS course. Since AP courses carry credibility with millions of students who take AP Exams as they are recognized with prospects of obtaining a college education, the hope was that the AP CS Principles course would lead to increased participation in AP CS Exams, especially with students historically excluded in CS including girls, Black, Hispanic, and Native American students, as well those with disabilities. The course raises opportunities and access to CS in higher education. The AP CS Principles curriculum framework is used in the development of the Exam which is significant in the creation college credit and placement policies. Nearly 1,300 colleges and universities have created policies providing students with opportunities to receive college credit or placement for scoring a 3 or higher on the AP CS Principles Exam [12]. The AP CS Principles curriculum framework is also used to define the learning outcomes for the course and stands as a pivotal tool in shaping high school CS education pathways to post-secondary introductory CS courses: It was designed to meet rigorous content requirements of an innovative first semester college-level introductory CS course. It exposes students to demanding expectations of building high levels of computational thinking skills and practical applications of programming that are valuable as they advance in their academics. It provides opportunities for students to connect fundamental programming concepts with important topics such as understanding the role of data in programming, and how data is processed and analyzed. AP CS Principles also recognizes the societal impacts of technology and teaches students about ethical considerations that may arise when analyzing bias in technological systems so that students develop a well-rounded perspective on technology's role in society [5]. Additional themes such as the infrastructure of the Internet including networks and protocols are also included. This paper focuses on the vision of the AP CS Principles course underpinnings (a) being engaging and appealing to a wider range of students, (b) making it accessible for a more racially, ethnically, and gender-identity diverse population of high school students, and (c) providing the benefits of the AP label on students' high school transcripts gives them options to consider a pathway into college CS studies with an enhanced admissions appeal, potential academic scholarships, and/or careers in the field. We investigate the structure of the AP CS Principles curriculum framework as a key resource that impacts the kinds of teaching and learning that is promoted in the Course and Exam Description. We discuss our experiences with the imbalanced emphasis on inclusive pedagogy and building community within the classroom to directly increase sense of belonging with students historically excluded from computing. Lastly, while the AP CS Principles Exam continues to flourish in participation numbers, we question the effectiveness of policies to promote broadening participation in computing. We review policies from three different states and discuss how they leverage the AP CS Principles course to promote teacher certification and student enrollment but do not necessarily ensure equitable practices to promote diverse representation in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic background, and disability.  © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), as a new future-oriented literacy, has gained attention at the basic education level. Graphical programming is the common way to develop CT in primary students, but this drag-and-drop programming may weaken students’ understanding of programming’s abstract concepts and code logic. Text-based programming approaches can solve the problems faced by graphical programming, but few studies have explored the impact of text-based programming on CT. Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 98 6th graders to explore the impact of gamified Python programming on CT. The findings showed that CT skills, as well as abstraction and decomposition, pattern recognition and evaluation in CT sub-skills, were significantly higher with students in the experimental group than in the control group. Furthermore, we found that gamified Python programming enabled boys and girls to reach the same level of CT skills. However, in terms of CT sub-skills, we found that gamified Python programming was more beneficial to the development of pattern recognition and evaluation skills for boys and abstraction and decomposition skills for girls. This demonstrated the effectiveness of gamified Python programming to improve primary students’ CT skills while clarifying the impact of gender and enriching research in the field of text-based programming. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  abstract = {In an age of rapid technological development, primary schools now teach programming to young students, focusing on developing their computational thinking, problem-solving, and ability to use computers to create solutions. However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python. This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment. Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {In this article, the issue of human behavior learning (HBL) is addressed for a class of nonlinear human-in-The-loop (HiTL) systems where the human operator is viewed as a nonlinear optimal controller. Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given. Then, a semidefinite programming problem with the quadratic objective function can be set up for determining the fuzzy weighting matrices of the cost function. The simulation study on a steering control system of the intelligent vehicle is given to show the effectiveness and applicability of the developed approach.  © 1993-2012 IEEE.}},

We propose design recommendations for future BBC micro:bit versions, advocating for integrating a gendersensitive participatory design approach to enhance the usability and engagement of computational and creative making with e-textiles for children of all genders. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

  abstract = {Although previous research has provided some insights into the effects of block-based and text-based programming modalities, there is a dearth of a detailed, multi-dimensional analysis of the transition process from different introductory programming modalities to professional programming learning. This study employed a quasi-experimental design to address this gap, involving 64 secondary school students in two groups. For the beginning five weeks, the first group used an introductory block-based programming environment, while the second group used an introductory text-based programming environment. Then, both groups transitioned to professional text-based programming for the subsequent eight weeks. The results showed that participants who transitioned from introductory text-based programming to professional text-based programming (1) significantly outperformed in computational thinking skills; (2) had more code-writing and debugging behaviors and fewer irrelevant behaviors, and (3) had more interactions with the instructor. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding enjoyment, confidence, and interest in programming. Drawing on these findings, this study proposes pedagogical implications that could facilitate the adoption of programming modalities within the broader context of STEM education. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance. Physicochemical properties can be used to supplement characterization information to improving model performance. The experimental results show that MAHyNet has better performance than other models.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.}},

However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices. This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys. Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

Twelve teacher teams, supported by researchers and ELL and SPED specialists, designed, piloted, and documented 23 modules of 4-8, 45-minute lessons across K-5. Early adopter teachers followed the pilots and implemented the modules in their classrooms with the goal of facilitating adoption by all elementary classroom teachers. After being interrupted by the pandemic, the RPP developed a strategy where principals in cohorts of schools agreed to collaborate with RPP school-based lead teachers to establish professional learning communities (PLCs) to support classroom implementation of the modules. Eleven schools participated in a 2021-22 cohort and nine more schools joined in 2022-23.

Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

Three Scratch learning topics were assessed based on the Dr. Scratch platform to acquire the level of students’ CT and to determine the low- and high-scoring groups. Results indicated that CT concepts and CT practices were always closely related in PP and CT practices, and CT perspectives could be gradually and closely related after a long period of CT training. A significant difference between the two groups’ CT structures was found. The high-scoring group had more fragments of CT practice and connecting of CT perspectives, while the low-scoring group showed more fragments of CT concepts and expressing of CT perspectives.

A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task.

  abstract = {Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops.

  abstract = {While computational thinking arises as an essential skill worldwide, formal primary and secondary education in Latin America rarely incorporates mechanisms to develop it in their curricula. The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {How to measure students' Computational Problem-Solving (CPS) competencies is an ongoing research topic. Prevalent approaches vary by measurement tools (e.g., interactive programming, multiple-choice tests, or programming-independent tests) and task types (e.g., debugging problems or Parson problems). However, few studies have examined the measurement tools of CPS competencies themselves: affordances and limitations of the measurement tools and how they compare, or whether different task types might elicit CPS competencies differently. Research needs to address these questions in order to better understand how to design robust, generalizable, and effective measurement tools for CPS competencies. This paper presents an exploratory study that contributes to this research direction. It is part of a larger international project to develop an open-access formative assessment platform for CPS, which includes a novel authoring tool for a wide range of task types for interactive block-based programming. We used the tool to create an interactive programming experience with multiple task types and gave it to more than 300 secondary school students from different countries. We also administered a validated multiple-choice measurement of Computational Thinking with block-based programs. We focused on task complexity as a characteristic of task type, using a classification scheme based on task design features. Comparing students' performances on tasks of different complexity and using two distinct measurement tools, we found that the multiple-choice measurement only partially predicts performance in the interactive programming task. Additionally, its predictive capacity varies significantly between task types of differing complexity. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

As part of the IECC's work, we conducted a survey of elementary teachers across the state. This poster will present our initial findings. Two of the research questions we addressed via the survey are: (1) What factors would motivate Idaho elementary teachers to pursue professional development (PD) related to CS? (2) What are elementary teachers' perceptions of the value of connecting CS education to rural community economies and industries? Descriptive analyses of 309 survey responses suggest that about three-quarters of elementary teachers reported that the following factors would be at least somewhat influential in their decisions to pursue CS PD: a K-5 computational thinking requirement, a district-wide CS planning staff, a pathway for elementary teachers to earn a certification in CS teaching, and a way to request CS PD funding. Few (9%) Idaho elementary teachers found that the perception of a disconnect between CS education and rural community interests was a significant barrier to elementary CS education. Even so, over 70% of them were moderately to strongly interested in mechanisms for connecting their CS education efforts to rural community industries through guest speakers and industry partnerships. The poster will discuss the implications of these and other emerging findings from the teacher survey, as well as IECC's related surveys of Idaho district superintendents and elementary school principals. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15% and 78% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.  © 2024 ACM.}},

We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation.

By examining commonalities among abstraction examples, key parts of the process of abstraction pertinent to elementary classrooms were identified: (1) the abstraction process is typically performed in reverse since students in elementary school are given abstractions to start with; (2) evaluation of concrete details to support an abstraction is part of the filtering step of abstraction; (3) in the absence of evaluation criteria, pattern recognition can be applied to a set of concrete examples to extract characteristics of an abstraction; and (4) abstractions can be supported by not only concrete details but other abstractions which students will need to develop an understanding of before fully comprehending the initial concept. Preliminary recommendations for abstraction instruction include having students evaluate examples; engaging students in pattern recognition to extract characteristics of an abstraction; developing student fluency in describing abstractions, their supporting examples, and characteristics; and assessing students by asking not only for examples of abstractions, but for their characteristics as well.  © 2024 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has rapidly captured-again-the attention of practitioners and the CS Education community. Several initiatives have been spawning to identify effective ways to introduce learners at college and high-school levels to the basics of AI. In this context, we developed Scratch-NB, an extension to the Scratch programming language to equip K-8 learners with foundational tools for developing a Naive-Bayes classifier, explicitly transparenting its internal components. We opted to use Scratch due to its popularity within the CS4All movement and its predominance in schools, and extend the language with a simple implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier as a gateway for introducing basic notions of supervised learning and AI. In this paper, we report the design rationale of our tool and our experience of using it in an informal workshop with children aged 10-12 with no prior knowledge of computational thinking, coding, or AI. The obtained results show that Scratch-NB showed high levels of acceptance among the participants, raised interest in AI, and effectively provided basic foundations, particularly when comparing Scratch-NB with other state-of-the-art tools targeted to this learner group. We argue that our tool has the potential to illuminate further practical and research endeavors when exploring how to effectively introduce younger populations to the foundational notions of AI in practical contexts.  © 2024 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking is gradually being introduced into elementary school curricula, usually accompanied by some form of programming activity. However, even a creative and hands-on activity such as programming Ozobot robots with color codes requires elementary school teachers to provide adequate help. We therefore developed hint cards based on criteria for effective feedback and common color code mode issues. Based on our experience of using the hint cards in 17 workshops in elementary schools with 328 children and 21 educators, we identify how the hint cards (1) address feedback challenges, (2) support learning, and (3) can be adapted for broader use. We find that hint cards provide benefits at the teacher, learner and organizational level, but also identify possible disadvantageous circumstances. Although the hint cards support learning regarding affective, cognitive and meta-cognitive aspects, strategies for adaptation are needed. We discuss how the hint cards can be used in other contexts, and give recommendations on how to use the knowledge of common issues and hint cards for supporting elementary school teachers with teaching programming.  © 2024 ACM.}},

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence and new theoretical perspectives on the mechanisms of interaction between CT and MT. To address this research gap, this study analyses the participants’ thinking processes in solving programming-based mathematical problems from a flexibility perspective, focusing on the interplay between computational and mathematical thinking, that is, how CT and MT work together to influence and determine the problem-solver’s choice of solution strategy. Using data collected from a large design-based study, we summarise two types of flexibility and six subtypes of flexibility demonstrated by participants in the programming-based mathematical problem-solving process using thematic analysis. These different types of flexibility provide researchers and mathematics educators with new theoretical perspectives to examine the interplay of CT and MT. Findings will also contribute toward student learning characteristics in programming-based mathematical problem-solving to sketch the big picture of how CT and MT emerge in complementary or mismatching ways. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences.

  abstract = {As one of the most popular visual programming languages, Scratch has a lot of evaluation around it. Reasonable evaluation can help programmers understand their projects better. At the same time, it can also provide a reference for them to browse other projects in the online community. Most of the existing evaluations on Scratch are carried from three perspectives: Computational Thinking (CT) ability, visual presentation aesthetics, and code quality. Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data. Combined with overall evaluations that represent human opinions, we analyze their differences and connections. Through experiments, we determine the weights of different integration policies, the proposed multi-view evaluation method can generate evaluation results similar to human opinions.  © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press.}},

However, when teaching new computing concepts to novice programmers, the number of example domain applications that can be presented is extremely limited.

As a result, there are few opportunities for students to take an active role in creating connections between computing concepts and situations where they can be applied. See Logic in Life exercises are short, non-programming exercises comprised of a logical and a visual component. The exercise format provides opportunities for students to explore and create their own connections between computing concepts and application domains. Further, by sharing these connections with fellow classmates, students are exposed to a breadth of applications for a given concept via a peer learning experience. Student feedback on the impacts of both creating and sharing computing connections via See Logic in Life exercises is presented.

This has led to critical analyses that reveal the inequitable conditions that children of color face in CS education. Intersectionality has also supported curricular innovations and interventions that aim to make CS education more equitable by being responsive to children's identities and communities.

To better understand what these different groups perceive to be the essential content of a foundational high school CS course, we conducted a series of focus groups. These focus groups explored participants' (n = 21) thinking about what content would be most important to prioritize in a required high school CS course. Transcripts of the focus groups were abductively coded and then analyzed to determine what CS content priorities were identified and what disagreements about priorities exist. We found that participants (1) emphasized CS knowledge and skills, with minimal reference to dispositions, (2) prioritized content similar to that found in current CS standards, (3) developed broad, high-level descriptions of content, (4) identified contextually relevant factors, (5) foregrounded AI both a tool and as a subdomain of CS, and (6) emphasized computational thinking. These findings can inform further research on the design and implementation of a required high school CS course designed to meet the needs of the future as well as to support revisions of CS standards for high school students. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

This landscape evaluation represents the baseline start of a wider, four-year national study around district capacity to collaboratively develop consistent and comprehensive K-12 computing pathways for their students and schools. The early landscape work we present here not only represents a starting point for comparing district educators' comprehension of CT (and computer science [CS]), but also acts as an early indicator as to what extent K-12 computing is a school and district-based priority, and to what degree teachers feel they have the capacity to meaningfully implement it. This poster relies on two data sources in a mixed-methods design: Districtwide surveys of teachers and administrators on their familiarity and prioritization of CT, coupled with subsequent hour-long focus group discussions with educators to expand upon their respective district landscape survey responses. Results point to all districts perceiving the broad applicability of CT as a skill set and its integrative potential in a range of subjects. Yet in terms of classroom implementation, teachers find such CT integration decidedly less clear, recognizing it to be a priority but also reporting as less confident about creating their own curricular materials, where CT situates with their district's ongoing initiatives, and where they can find curricular resources and tools specific to their own areas of curricular integration. © 2024 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Artificial general intelligence revived in recent years after people achieved significant advances in machine learning and deep learning. This leads to the thinking of how real intelligence could be created. Consciousness theories believe that general intelligence is essentially conscious, yet no universal definition is agreed upon. In this work, global workspace (GW) theory is implemented and integrated with crucial cognitive components. With the focus on episodic memory and inspiration from the nature of episodic memory in psychology and neuroscience, the episodic memory component is implemented within the GW framework. In our experiment, the robotic agent operates in a real-world interactive context, forming episodic memory and demonstrating static, temporal, and context memory capabilities during interactions. Consciousness in this work engages in all formation, maintenance, and retrieval processes of episodic memory. The novelty and contributions of this work are: 1) this work is implementing episodic memory within the consciousness framework, suggesting the sustainable potential of such an integrated approach to cognitive agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI); 2) regarding the limited examples in consciousness-based cognitive architectures, this work attempts to contribute to the diversity of perspectives and approaches; 3) extant episodic memory implementations are suffering from various limitations, while this work summarises some key features for modeling episodic memory within a cognitive architecture; and 4) authors discuss the relationship between episodic memory, consciousness, and general intelligence, proposing the compatibility and relationship between machine consciousness and other AGI research.

Although the significance of CT has been highlighted, it could be challenging for educators to teach CT. Fortunately, adopting robots in education has been evidenced to be of benefit to promoting students’ learning motivation, CT, and higher-order thinking skills. However, several significant factors affecting students’ programming performances in robot-assisted learning activities have been identified, such as cognitive needs and organization. In this study, a CMR-BBP (concept map robot block-based programming) approach was designed by integrating concept maps into robot block-based programming to enhance students’ programming learning. Moreover, a three-group experiment was carried out in an elementary school to evaluate their learning outcomes. The experimental results revealed that the CMR-BBP approach benefited the students’ perceptions of their computational thinking and problem solving in comparison with the R-BBP (robot block-based programming) and C-BBP (conventional block-based programming) approaches. Furthermore, regarding cognitive load, both the CMR-BBP and R-BBP approaches enhanced the students’ germane cognitive load, while the CMR-BBP approach effectively reduced their extrinsic cognitive load.

However, software engineering education has not adequately addressed integrating comprehensive data science curricula, leaving students ill-equipped for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which is built on the foundations of data science.

Consequently, students often miss out on essential skills like data cleanup, real-world application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the integration of big data in software products. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach to applied data science for software engineering students. We argue for a shift from traditional algorithm-focused teaching to a curriculum emphasizing real-world problem-solving, lever-aging data science techniques. By empowering students to define and tackle their own data-driven projects, we aim to increase motivation, enhance data literacy, and instill a data-thinking mindset in future software engineers to prepare them for the AI world.

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel automated approach to medical data classification using an interval type-2 fuzzy thinking system (IT2FLS) and wavelet transformation (WT). Wavelet coefficients are highly discriminative features that serve as condensed reconstructions of the underlying data. Uncertainty and high-dimensional data provide issues that are addressed by the combination of WT and IT2FLS. With the use of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering for unsupervised structure learning and evolutionary algorithms for supervised parameter adjustment, the IT2FLS employs a hybrid learning approach. The use of WT streamlines this computationally demanding learning process, lowering computational load and improving IT2FLS performance. Well-known medical datasets (Cleveland heart disease and Wisconsin breast cancer) from the UCI Collection for machine learning are used for experimental assessments. Computed performance measures include area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The findings demonstrate the better efficacy of the wavelet-IT2FLS methodology in comparison to other machine learning techniques, such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, fuzzy ARTMAP, support vector machine, and probabilistic neural network. The suggested approach has potential to assist clinicians and medical professionals in making decisions. © 2024 IEEE.}},

With the widespread application of large language models in education, intelligent-assisted teaching in entrepreneurship education is stepping into a new learning phase anytime and anywhere. Entrepreneurship education extends across interdisciplinary knowledge fields, incorporating subjects like finance and risk management, which require advanced mathematical computational skills. This complexity presents new challenges for artificial intelligence-assisted question-and-answer models. The study explores how students can maximize the knowledge repository of current large language models to improve learning efficiency. Experimentally validates the performance differences between large language models and graph convolutional reasoning models regarding the complex semantic reasoning and mathematical computational demands in entrepreneurship education questions. Based on case studies, it is found that despite the broad prospects of large language models in entrepreneurship education, they still need to improve in practical applications. Especially in tasks within entrepreneurship education that demand precision, such as mathematical computations and risk assessment, the accuracy and efficiency of existing models still need improvement. Therefore, further exploration into algorithm optimization, model fusion, and other technical enhancements can improve the processing capabilities of intelligent question-and-answer systems for specific domain issues, aiming to meet the practical needs of entrepreneurship education.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one.

  abstract = {The rapid growing application of language models (LLMs) in education offers exciting prospects for personalized learning and interactive experiences. However, a critical challenge emerges - the risk of "hallucinations," where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information. This paper proposes Comparative and Cross-Verification Prompting (CCVP), a novel technique specifically designed to mitigate hallucinations in educational LLMs. CCVP leverages the strengths of multiple LLMs, a Principal Language Model (PLM) and Auxiliary Language Models (ALMs), to verify the accuracy and educational relevance of the PLM's response to a prompt. Through a series of prompts and assessments, CCVP harnesses the diverse perspectives of various LLMs and incorporates human expertise for intricate cases. This method addresses the limitations of relying on a single model and fosters critical thinking skills in learners within the educational context. We detail the CCVP approach with examples specifically applicable to educational settings, such as geography. We also discuss its strengths and limitations, including computational cost, data reliance, and ethical considerations. We highlight its potential applications in educational disciplines, including fact-checking content, detecting bias, and promoting responsible LLM use. CCVP presents a promising avenue for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated educational content. Further research and development will refine its scalability, address potential biases, and solidify its position as a vital tool for harnessing the power of LLMs while fostering responsible knowledge dissemination in education. © 2024 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Securing user electronics devices has become a significant concern in the digital period, and a forward-thinking solution covers the fusion of blockchain (BC) technology and deep learning (DL) methods. Blockchain improves device safety by transforming access management, storing credentials on a tamper-resistant ledger, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and giving a robust defence against malevolent actors. Integrating DL into this framework also raises safety measures, as it permits devices to inspect and regulate to develop attacks distinctly. DL models accurately recognize intricate designs and anomalies, allowing the technique to distinguish and threaten possible attacks in real time. The fusion of BC and DL not only improves the reliability of user electronics but also establishes a dynamic and adaptive safety system, enhancing consumer confidence in the safety of their devices. Therefore, this study presents a BC-Based Access Management with DL Threat Modeling (BCAM-DLTM) technique for securing consumer electronics devices in the IoT ecosystems. The BCAM-DLTM technique mainly follows a two-phase procedure: access management and threat detection. Moreover, BC technology can be applied to the access management of consumer electronics devices. Besides, the BCAM-DLTM technique applies a deep belief networks (DBNs) model for proficiently identifying threats. To enhance the recognition results of the DBN model, the hyperparameter tuning procedure uses the reptile search algorithm (RSA). The experimental outcome study of the BCAM-DLTM approach employs the NSLKDD dataset. The comprehensive results of the BCAM-DLTM approach portrayed a superior accuracy outcome of 99.63% over existing models in terms of distinct metrics.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a transversal ability to solve problems in any area, is crucial for Computer Programming. We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

Today's 'digital natives' have grown up in a world where technology is rapidly evolving, creating new fields of study, new types of jobs, and requiring new skill sets. Algorithmic and computational thinking are foundations for solving different problems from all domains and are not always closely related to computers and programming. They are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and STEM subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. The paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital ('plugged') and non-digital ('unplugged') activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking. Four methodological scenarios with activities for the development of algorithmic thinking in primary education are presented.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In the last decade, educational reforms introduced technologies and digital tools to a higher degree, serving as powerful catalysts in educational innovation for creating, managing, and delivering content in STEM education with a focus on computational and engineering subjects. However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8-9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8-9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.  © 2024 IEEE.}},

CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils' CT perspective and form their computational identity.

The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity.

Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies.

Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children.

Seventy-six first-year undergraduates participated, including thirty in the CBS group and thirty-six in the COS group. Evaluations made from the results and processes of programming tasks were employed to describe computational performance and computational practices, respectively. Data gathered from CT skill surveys were thoroughly analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of computational perspectives.

While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS.

  abstract = {IoT devices have changed into one of the mainstays in areas like houses, industry and education, resulting in a level of convenience and efficiency that has never been achieved before. Even though the most important advantage of the distributed network is raising the level of security, the problem of security vulnerabilities with the extended networks remains. This paper is devoted to a novel strategy of Federated Learning (FL) that could become an applied solution for enhancing the safety of the IoT. Therefore, based on its decentralized knowledge process, FL allows IoT devices to cooperate in achieving common purposes without endangering data pri vacy. The paper uses this thinking method to deal with scalability, model personalization, and non-IID data that aren't IID distributing, suggesting solutions through model aggregation techniques or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Experimental evidence highlights that FL is very useful in enhancing IoT security irrespective of the diversity of its applications. To this end, residents of smart homes experienced a 17% increase in detecting the anomalies through the setting up of FL. This situation was replicated in the industrial Internet of Things, where the false positive rates were reduced from 20% to 5%, thus improving the system's efficiency. Furthermore, in the FL context in healthcare IoT ecosystems, this blazes a trail for privacy-preserving data analytics, preserving patient confidentiality and systematic profiling of noteworthy health trends. These findings thus demonstrate that FL is a feasible way of dealing with the security challenges of IoT scalable, promptly and in a manner that maintains user privacy. The article takes part in a conversation about ways to strengthen the security of IoT networks. Such a framework is based on the computational power of IoT devices. It allows us to detect and prevent threats in time. Nonetheless, it urges extensive R&D attempts to be introduced to develop better security solutions in IoT. Without the involvement of different technologies, it won't be easy to ensure safety and create some reliable IoT ecosystems. © 2024 IEEE.}},

This study explores the utilization of factor graphs in modeling the autonomous racecar planning problem, presenting an alternate perspective to the traditional optimizationbased formulation. We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack. Furthermore, the results highlight the computational efficiency of our approach.

These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don't consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies.

The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan. <italic>Background:</italic> The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course. <italic>Intended Outcomes:</italic> The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens. <italic>Application Design:</italic> The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning. <italic>Findings:</italic> This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.

  abstract = {Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

Prediction of ASD using video recordings is an open-ended critical problem in machine learning to facilitate the process of early intervention which requires high computational resources. This research aims to predict ASD in children using videos by extracting features and converting them into a binary classification problem thereby eliminating the need for high computational resources. This research postulates a study of machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks in comparison for the prediction of ASD as well as a novel approach to reduce the computational requirements for the analysis of videos. This research also addresses the lack of publically available video datasets for the analysis of Autism. The highest accuracy metric for the models was using the Neural Network architecture closely followed by the Decision Tree Classifier which yielded accuracies of 99.8% and 99.65% respectively.

  abstract = {In advance to the present study, the authors introduced a method which makes it possible to calculate the entropy of natural language digital texts, focusing on word-processed texts, presentations, and webpages. This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses - the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data - generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group (2×67 hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students' and end-users' computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability - beyond hardware and software development and recycling - with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified. However, the near future is to run parallel the reactive and proactive uses of this approach, while if we look far into the future, the proactive use to digital born natural language texts should dominate.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Teaching programming is a topic that has generated a high level of interest among researchers in recent decades. In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on 'Learning by Teaching,' where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre-posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

  author = {Munasinghe B.; Bell T.; Robins A.}},
  year = {2023}},
  journal = {ACM Transactions on Computing Education}},
  abstract = {In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming. It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution. In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

First, by analyzing the thinking skills that have the greatest impact on top talents, the features of critical thinking skills, logical thinking skills and computational thinking skills are extracted separately. Then, a learner classification model for top talents was constructed by MKL method. Finally, the model was validated on the dataset and compared with the results of single-kernel learning. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the classification model for top talents based on MKL is significantly better than that of ordinary single-kernel learning, which indicates that the method of MKL performs better in the learner classification model. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To date, ER has focused on the use of robots to augment learning of adjacent fields (e.g., mathematics, programming, digital media) for K - 12 students. As a result, we lack ER guidelines for: (1) supporting college robotics students learning the discipline of robotics itself and (2) college robotics students, who may possess distinct abilities and needs compared to K - 12 students. To address this gap, we present a semester-long exploration of a college-levelIntroduction to Robotics course.

On the one hand, this brings us to analyze the relations and intersections between different process of thought (analytical, logical, mathematical, system, engineering, algorithmic) and the role of search for simplicity, generalization, and scalability in the layers of abstraction in Computational Thinking. On the other hand, we explore the roots and the discursive environment of authors that could contribute to this conceptualizing process in the years around its popularization following Jeannette Wing’s founding article in 2006. We have also included in our analysis the points of convergence with Seymour Papert’s work related to the computer-machine seen as an “object-to-think-with” helping to the construction of knowledge from an epistemological perspective to the computing-human. Even though a consensus on the definition of the concept has not yet ben encountered, the analysis helps to highlight the solid reference points that address what is at the core of Computational thinking and what should be the framework of educational interventions and research that revolve around it. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is viewed as a support structure for educators to develop computational literacies [18][35]. The majority of research around CT practices has focused on decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking; however, there is little research on debugging and how teachers see the role of debugging in their instruction [4][17]. Given that debugging is viewed as a vital CT skill [38], there is a need to understand how elementary teachers perceive its role in supporting student learning. In this paper, we present results from a study that examined how elementary teachers understood debugging as well as how they saw the role of debugging to support student learning. Our findings indicate that most elementary teachers perceived debugging as a metacognitive support that allowed their students to shift how they approached problem-solving. Our findings also suggest that debugging may be a good starting point to allow elementary teachers to initially latch onto integrating CT. We discuss implications of our findings for integrating CT practices into classroom instruction. © 2023 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Since the release of LLM-based tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT the media and popular scientific literature, but also journals such as the Communications of the ACM, have been flooded with opinions how these tools will change programming. The opinions range from “machines will program themselves”, to “AI does not help programmers”. Of course, these statements are meant to to stir up a discussion, and should be taken with a grain of salt, but we argue that such unfounded statements are potentially harmful. Instead, we propose to investigate which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. In this paper we report on an experiment in which we explore if Computational Thinking (CT) skills predict the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools. Our results show that the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools can indeed be predicted by the score on a CT assessment. There are many limitations to our experiment, and this paper is also a call to discuss how to approach, preferably experimentally, the question of which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. We propose to rephrase this question to include by what kind of people/programmers, to develop what kind of software using what kind of LLM-based tools. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess CT in schools. This review applied a semi-automatic search for specific terms within the selected papers. These terms came from the analysis of several established definitions of CT. Results: We present a set of the most representative competencies and concepts developed in various experiences, in which the main topic is the assessment of CT, as well as some that have not been developed and that may be the subject of future works.

  abstract = {Background: Early exposure to Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) for all is critical to broaden participation and promote equity in the field. But how does the introduction of CS and CT into primary school curricula impact learning, perception, and gaps between groups of students? Methodology: We investigate a CS-curricular reform and teacher Professional Development (PD) programme from an equity standpoint by applying hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling on student learning and perception data from three studies with, respectively, 1384, 2433 and 1644 grade 3–6 students (ages 7–11) and their 83, 142 and 95 teachers. Results: Regarding learning, exposure to CS instruction appears to contribute to closing the performance gap between low-achieving and high-achieving students, as well as pre-existing gender gaps. Despite a lack of direct influence of what was taught on student learning, there is no impact of teachers’ demographics or motivation on student learning, with teachers’ perception of the CS-PD positively influencing learning. Regarding perception, students perceive CS and its teaching tools (robotics, tablets) positively, and even more so when they perceive a role model close to them as doing CS. Nonetheless, gender differences exist all around with boys perceiving CS more positively than girls despite access to CS education. However, access to CS-education affects boys and girls differently: larger gender gaps are closing (namely those related to robotics), while smaller gaps are increasing (namely those related to CS and tablets). Conclusion: This article highlights how a CS curricular reform impacts learning, perception, and equity and supports the importance of (i) early introductions to CS for all; (ii) preparing teachers to teach CS all the while removing the influence of teacher demographics and motivation on student outcomes; and (iii) having developmentally appropriate activities that signal to all groups of students. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.}},

Expanding interest in implementing a game-based approach in computer science education highlights the need for a comprehensive overview of the literature research. This scoping review aims to provide insight into current trends and identify research gaps and potential research topics concerning game-based learning in computer science. Using standard methodology for scoping review, we identified 113 articles from four digital libraries published between 2017 and 2021. Those articles were analyzed concerning the educational level, type of the game, computer science topic covered by the game, pedagogical strategies, and purpose for implementing this approach in different educational levels. The results show that the number of research articles has increased through the years, confirming the importance of implementing a game-based approach in computer science. Different kinds of games, using different technology, concerning different computer science topics are presented in the research. The obtained results indicate that there is no standardized game or standardized methodology that can be used for the creation of an educational game for computer science education. Analyzed articles mainly implement a game-based approach using learning by playing, and no significant focus is given to the effectiveness of learning by designing a game as a pedagogical strategy. Moreover, the approach is mainly implemented for developing computational thinking or programming skills, highlighting the need for its implementation in other topics beyond programming. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.}},

  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems}},
  abstract = {In this article, we propose a computationally and communicationally efficient approach for decision-making in nonequilibrium stochastic games. In particular, due to the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose nonequilibrium strategies, we construct two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning. In the first model, named level- $k$ thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs and - given such an assumption - chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, a level-recursive algorithm and a level-paralleled algorithm are constructed, where the latter one can have an overall reduced computational complexity. To further reduce the complexity in the communication layer, modifications of the proposed nonequilibrium strategies are presented, which do not require the action of a boundedly rational agent to be updated at each step of the stochastic game. Simulations are performed that demonstrate our results. © 2012 IEEE.}},

We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their preservice coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher’s CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

  journal = {International Journal of STEM Education}},
  abstract = {Background: There exist shared competencies between computational thinking (CT) and mathematics, and these two domains also mutually benefit from various teaching approaches. However, the linkages between mathematics and computational thinking lack robust empirical support, particularly from student-centered learning perspectives. Our study aimed to enhance our understanding of the connections between students' mathematics learning and computational thinking. To assess students' mathematics learning, we measured their beliefs about mathematics learning and their level of mathematical literacy (ML). Our hypothesis posited that students' beliefs concerning mathematics learning, encompassing their views on the nature of mathematics and their attitude towards the subject, can both directly and indirectly influence their CT, with ML serving as a mediating factor. Our data were gathered through surveys and tests administered to eighth- and ninth-grade students. Data were analyzed using partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS–SEM). Results: The evaluation of the measurement model indicated strong internal consistency for each construct. Both convergent and discriminant validity were also established. Upon assessing the structural model, it was found that beliefs about the nature of mathematics positively predicted attitudes towards mathematics, and this belief also indirectly predicted ML through positive attitudes towards mathematics. In addition, ML directly and positively predicted both CT subscales. Notably, a comprehensive mediating effect of ML on beliefs about mathematics learning and CT was identified in the analysis. Conclusions: This study advances the understanding of the relationships between mathematics learning and CT. We have further confirmed the importance of mathematical literacy in predicting CT and its mediating role between beliefs about mathematics learning and CT. It is suggested that teachers could promote students’ CT competence by enhancing their mathematical literacy or integrating mathematics and CT into the same learning activities. Finally, we propose that upcoming investigations treat CT assessments as formative constructs, diverging from their reflective counterparts. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design, implementation and research of the Cyber Sleuth Science Lab (CSSL), an innovative educational program and supporting virtual learning environment, that combines pedagogical theory, gender inclusive instruction strategies, scientific principles/practices, gamification methods, computational thinking, and real-world problem solving. This program provides underrepresented youth, especially girls, with digital forensic knowledge, skills and career pathways, challenging them to explore complex social issues related to technology and to become cyber sleuths using real-world digital forensic methods and tools to solve investigative scenarios. Students also learn about related careers while improving their cyber street smarts. The CSSL incorporates additional “outside of the computer” activities to strengthen students’ engagement such as structured in-classroom discussions, mock trials, and in-person interactions with practitioner role models. The CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings, and the students predominantly represented racial minorities. Research in this project relied on a mixed methods approach for data collection and analysis,including qualitative and quantitative methods, reinforced using learning analytics generated from the students clicking through the interface and interacting with the system. Analysis of gathered data indicate that the virtual learning environment developed in this project is highly effective for teaching digital forensic knowledge, skills, and abilities that are directly applicable in the workplace. Furthermore, the strategies for gender inclusive STEM instruction implemented in CSSL are effective for engaging girls without being harmful to boys’ engagement. Learning STEM through digital forensic science taps into girls’ motivations to address real-world problems that have direct relevance to their lives, and to protect and serve their community. After participating in the educational program, girls expressed a significantly greater increase in interest, relative to boys, in learning more about careers related to digital forensics and cybersecurity. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

Many empirical studies in this area have yet to elaborate clearly and explicitly on how CT may support mathematics learning, or otherwise, in CT-based mathematics activities. Addressing this research gap, we conducted a systematic review on the integration of CT in K-12 mathematics education with a focus on CT-based mathematics instruction and students learning under such instruction. The Web of Science database was searched for in terms of studies published from 2006 to 2021, from which 24 articles were selected to provide illustrations of CT-based mathematics instruction and related student learning, and they were further analyzed according to education levels and contexts, programming tools, learning outcomes in CT and mathematics, and the mutual relationship between CT and mathematics learning. Among the results, this review found that geometrized programming and student-centered instructional approaches were facilitators of productive learning in CT and mathematics. Moreover, CT-based mathematics learning entails an interactive and cyclical process of reasoning mathematically and reasoning computationally, which can occur when: (1) applying mathematics to construct CT artefacts; (2) applying mathematics to anticipate and interpret CT outputs; and (3) generating new mathematical knowledge in parallel with the development of CT. The findings contribute to an in-depth understanding of what, and how, CT-based mathematics instruction impacts student learning in K-12 contexts. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

Currently, about half of secondary schools in the United States have computer science education available to students in some form. Unfortunately, many of these schools choose a curriculum bogged down in the nuances of programming language syntax, leaving students bored, confused, unable to apply their learning to useful problems outside the classroom, and therefore disheartened about further pursuing a more conceptual computer science education in college. As a current undergraduate who has helped teach secondary school computer science, I witnessed firsthand the problems with current approaches. I, therefore, propose a shift in the focus of computing education research away from teaching “coding” effectively to elucidating a more abstract but nevertheless more pragmatic characterization of computer science as an academic field, rather than programming as a trade. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

  abstract = {Unplugged activities as a low-cost solution to foster computational thinking (CT) skills seem to be a trend in recent years. However, current evidence of the effectiveness of unplugged activities in promoting students’ CT skills has been inconsistent. To understand the potential of unplugged activities on computational thinking skills, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Our review of 49 studies examined the influence of unplugged activities to improve students’ CT skills in K–12 education between 2006 and 2022. The literature review showed that studies on CT skills were mainly (81.64%) conducted in computer science and STEM education, with board and card games being the most common unplugged activities for fostering CT skills in K–12 education. CT diagnostic tools (36.37%) were frequently used as assessment tools. A follow-up meta-analysis of 13 studies with 16 effect sizes showed a generally large overall effect size (Hedges’s g = 1.028, 95% CI [0.641, 1.415], p < 0.001) for the use of unplugged activities in promoting students’ CT skills. The analysis of several moderator variables (i.e., grade level, class size, intervention duration, and learning tools) and their possible effects on CT skills indicated that unplugged activities are a promising instructional strategy for enhancing students’ CT skills. Taken together, the results highlight the affordances of unplugged pedagogy for promoting CT skills in K–12 education. Recommendations for policies, practice, and research are provided accordingly. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {Researchers are increasingly exploring educational games in immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments to facilitate students’ learning experiences. Mainly, the effect of IVR on learning outcomes has been the focus. However, far too little attention has been paid to the influence of game elements and IVR features on learners’ perceived cognition. This study examined the relationship between game elements (challenge, goal clarity, and feedback) as pedagogical approach, features of IVR technology (immersion and interaction), and learners’ perceived cognition (reflective thinking and comprehension). An experiment was conducted with 49 undergraduate students who played an IVR game-based application (iThinkSmart) containing mini games developed to facilitate learners’ computational thinking competency. The study employed partial least squares structural equation modelling to investigate the effect of educational game elements and learning contents on learner’s cognition. Findings show that goal clarity is the main predictor of learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension in an educational game-based IVR application. It was also confirmed that immersion and interaction experience impact learner’s comprehension. Notably, adequate learning content in terms of the organisation and relevance of the content contained in an IVR game-based application significantly moderate learners’ reflective thinking and comprehension. The findings of this study have implications for educators and developers of IVR game-based intervention to facilitate learning in the higher education context. In particular, the implication of this study touches on the aspect of learners’ cognitive factors that aim to produce 21st-century problem-solving skills through critical thinking. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {Contemporary science is a field that is becoming increasingly computational. Today’s scientists not only leverage computational tools to conduct their investigations, they often must contribute to the design of the computational tools for their specific research. From a science education perspective, for students to learn authentic science practices, students must learn to use the tools of the trade. This necessity in science education has shaped recent K–12 science standards including the Next Generation Science Standards, which explicitly mention the use of computational tools and simulations. These standards, in particular, have gone further and mandated that computational thinking be taught and leveraged as a practice of science. While computational thinking is not a new term, its inclusion in K–12 science standards has led to confusion about what the term means in the context of science learning and to questions about how to differentiate computational thinking from other commonly taught cognitive skills in science like problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, and critical thinking. In this paper, we propose a definition of computational thinking for science (CT-S) and a framework for its operationalization in K–12 science education. We situate our definition and framework in Activity Theory, from the learning sciences, in order to position computational thinking as an input to and outcome of science learning that is mediated by computational tools. © 2023, The Author(s).}},

Findings: Our results demonstrate the tools (CT) employed in the PS process in CH and CA mathematics textbooks. The strong connections between the “look back” stage and CT tools were explored. During the “look back” stage, both countries required students to transfer their knowledge and perform generalization. In addition, CT is regarded as a basic skill analysis for students in mathematics education and has received significant attention at every stage of the PS process.

The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students’ CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges’ g =.600, 95% CI [.465,.735], p <.001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students’ CT concepts (Hedges’ g =.916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p <.001), CT skills (Hedges’ g =.494, 95% CI [.389,.600], p <.001), and CT perspectives (Hedges’ g =.927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p <.05).

This paper reports on our recent development of the deterministic random walk model in NetLogo, a leading platform for computational thinking, eco-system thinking, and multi-agent cross-platform programming environment. The deterministic random walk is foundational to modeling dynamical processes on complex networks. Inspired by the temporal visualizations offered in NetLogo, we investigated the relationship between network topology and diffusion saturation time for the deterministic random walk model. Our analysis uncovers that in Erdős–Rényi graphs, the saturation time exhibits an asymmetric pattern with a considerable probability of occurrence. This behavior occurs when the hubs, defined as nodes with relatively higher number of connections, emerge in Erdős–Rényi graphs. Yet, our analysis yields that the hubs in Barabási–Albert model stabilize the the convergence time of the deterministic random walk model. These findings strongly suggest that depending on the dynamical process running on complex networks, complementing characteristics other than the degree need to be taken into account for considering a node as a hub.

Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT, but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g., conditions, triggers, and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students’ preferences for using CT elements. Game elements, particularly clear goals and rules, progressive challenges, immediate feedback, storyline, avatar, social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore, single or multiple theoretical foundations, such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory, may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities. Problem-solving, project-based approaches were used to encourage students to use CT to solve problems or complete a project.

The advantage of quantum computing is that it has the potential to solve computationally complex problems in a fixed amount time, independent of the size of the problem. However, the kinds of problems for which these computers are a good fit, and the ways to express those problems, are substantially different from the kinds of problems and expressions used in classical computing. Quantum annealers, in particular, are currently the most promising and available quantum computing devices in the short term. However, they are also the most foreign compared to classical programs, as they require a different kind of computational thinking. In order to ease the transition into this new world of quantum computing, we present a novel quantum approach to a well-known software problem: code clone detection. We express code clone detection as a subgraph isomorphism problem that is mapped into a quadratic optimization problem, and solve it using a DWave quantum annealing computer. We developed a quantum annealing algorithm that compares Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and reports an energy value that indicates how similar they are. The motivation behind this research goes well beyond code duplicate detection: our approach paves the way into how to express software engineering problems as optimization problems that can be solved by quantum annealers.  © 2023 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed debate about whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be conscious or sentient. This paper identifies two approaches to the topic and argues: (1) A 'Cartesian' approach treats consciousness, sentience, and personhood as very similar terms, and treats language use as evidence that an entity is conscious. This approach, which has been dominant in AI research, is primarily interested in what consciousness is, and whether an entity possesses it. (2) An alternative 'Hobbesian' approach treats consciousness as a sociopolitical issue and is concerned with what the implications are for labeling something sentient or conscious. This both enables a political disambiguation of language, consciousness, and personhood and allows regulation to proceed in the face of intractable problems in deciding if something 'really is' sentient. (3) AI systems should not be treated as conscious, for at least two reasons: (a) treating the system as an origin point tends to mask competing interests in creating it, at the expense of the most vulnerable people involved; and (b) it will tend to hinder efforts at holding someone accountable for the behavior of the systems. A major objective of this paper is accordingly to encourage a shift in thinking. In place of the Cartesian question - is AI sentient? - I propose that we confront the more Hobbesian one: Does it make sense to regulate developments in which AI systems behave as if they were sentient?  © 2020 Tsinghua University Press.}},

Although there have been some approaches to teach computational thinking using physical computing and focusing on solving real-world problems (e.g., electronic devices such as Arduino, using sensors and actuators), they often entail monetary expenses and require knowledgeable instructors, and are not catered to students without prior programming or electronics knowledge. Hence, we propose the use of Protobject, a low-cost tool that focuses on real-world applications that could be used to teach programming to design students. This study aims to evaluate students' perceptions regarding the usability of Protobject as a tool for learning computational thinking, as well as the clarity of the learning activities designed to teach computational thinking concepts by using Protobject.  © 2023 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Research has shown that free-form Game-Design (GD) environments can be very effective in fostering Computational Thinking (CT) skills at a young age. However, some students can still need some guidance during the learning process due to the highly open-ended nature of these environments. Intelligent Pedagogical Agents (IPAs) can be used to provide personalized assistance in real-time to alleviate this challenge. This paper presents our results in evaluating such an agent deployed in a real-word free-form GD learning environment to foster CT in the early K-12 education, Unity-CT. We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make fewer errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Building from these results, we provide insights on how to provide IPA interventions in free-form GD environments. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {Pattern recognition is an important skill in computational thinking. In this study, an equation puzzle game was developed by combining pattern recognition with algebraic reasoning, and scaffolding was designed to support learners' learning. Sixty participants were enrolled in this study, divided into a control group and an experimental group to compare the results and differences in game achievement, flow, anxiety, and motivation of participants with and without algebraic reasoning scaffolding. The results of the study showed that the participants in both groups had positive flow and motivation during the game, did not feel over-anxious, and there was no significant difference in the game achievement of the two groups. In addition, the game with the scaffolding may have the potential to make a positive correlation between game achievement and psychological status. The results of this study indicated that the game did not cause too much anxiety to the participants. The scaffolding-based design achieves the intended effect on the participants' assistance and facilitates the participants' engagement in pattern recognition problem solving. And as learners became more focused and engaged, they could also perform better in the game. This game mechanism can be used as a reference for designing pattern recognition games. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

How to improve students “interest in program logic design and help overcome students” fears of coding has become vital for educators. Cultivating practical talents with information technology application and basic programming development will become one of the important topics in the department of information related science. The objective of this research is to improve the ability of learning basic programming courses by using Zuvio interactive software. Zuvio employs the mathematical logic of computational thinking to analyze problems and enhance learners’ interest in learning programming skills through a graphical interface tool with building blocks. It uses innovative interactive teaching to use peer and self-assessment to study the content of the course. Zuvio improves the design ability of different groups of class learning Python programming. In line with the innovative teaching policy of the schools and the current stage of the learner’s learning model, learning effectiveness can be achieved. The research results were analyzed by midterm and final experimental group scores, and the progress of the experimental group’s scores was examined through descriptive statistics. The average and standard deviation of the assessment were used to analyze the progress of the experimental group students in the programming course. In the classroom, assessment criteria were set up as the basis for peer assessment scoring. After the midterm and final exams, the teacher assessment and peer assessment scores were analyzed for cognitive differences, and possible learning differences were analyzed. The students’ professional ability was examined to see if it met the professional standards required by the course, and whether innovative teaching methods could improve the learning outcomes of learners with different professional backgrounds in Python programming. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

Thus, we developed a course to facilitate the transition from BBP to TBP and foster CT while also promoting motivation and students' programming-related self-concept. We considered data from 27 fourth-grade students aged 9 to 10, who participated in the course as part of an extracurricular enrichment program. In a pre-/post-test design, we assessed CT and its cognitive correlates such as non-verbal visuospatial reasoning, verbal reasoning, arithmetic competencies as well as the student's motivation and attitude towards programming. Results indicated improved students' CT, arithmetic, and non-verbal visuospatial reasoning. Furthermore, the transition to TBP did not significantly reduce students' motivation for programming.

However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and 75 fifth-grade students attended the unassisted flipped debugging training lessons without the SDP–modeling method. The results indicated that flipped debugging training using the SDP–modeling method improved students’ debugging skills. The results from the questionnaire showed that the proposed teaching approach increased the students’ investment in germane cognitive load by promoting schema construction. It also helped reduce students’ intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in learning. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

As primary school teachers often lack subject knowledge, they may struggle to help students during these programming activities. Additional support can be provided by automated program analysis, for example in terms of hints on conceptual knowledge related to bad coding patterns observed, or procedural hints on how to solve the task at hand. However, care has to be taken since these hints need to balance (1) helping students to perform a specific task successfully, while nevertheless (2) ensuring a learning effect beyond the specific task. To understand the effects of different types of hints we therefore conducted a study with 36 children aged 7-12 in 10 programming courses. After being introduced to basic programming structures in three units, the children were tasked to debug six Scratch programs using different types of hints, where we observed that procedural hints have the strongest impact on performance. In order to examine an impact on the transfer of learned knowledge, we observed the children's difficulties during the successive fifth unit, in which they created their own projects. The results of the fifth unit show that having received a procedural hint on a specific pattern during the fourth unit leads to slightly fewer bad related code patterns but also to slightly fewer good code patterns. Considering these results together with the subjective perceptions of the children, we can derive insights into how to best support performance and learning using (automated) feedback.  © 2023 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking is a way of thinking that helps people “think like a computer scientist” to solve practical problems. However, practicing computational thinking through programming is dependent on the problem solvers’ metacognition. This study investigated students’ metacognitive planning and problem-solving performance in programming through two quantitative studies. First, we analyzed the performance of metacognitive planning and of problem solving through the programming of 21 freshmen, and found that the metacognitive planning performance related to “problem description” and “program comprehension” was significantly correlated with problem-solving performance. Second, semi-scaffolding and full-scaffolding were designed based on the first study. Another 89 freshmen were randomly divided into three groups and were asked to write their programming plan with no-scaffolding, semi-scaffolding, or with full-scaffolding. ANCOVA revealed that the problem-solving performance of the no-scaffolding group was significantly weaker than that of the other two groups, but there was no significant difference between the semi-scaffolding and the full-scaffolding groups. The study indicated that semi-scaffolding had a similar effect to full-scaffolding on problem-solving performance. The study suggests that teachers should emphasize supporting students’ “problem description” and “program comprehension” using semi-scaffolding.

This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.  © 2016 IEEE.}},

To explore how teachers generally proceed when creating programming tasks, whether tool support can help, and how it is perceived by teachers, we performed a pre-study with 26 and a main study with 59 teachers in training and the LitterBox static analysis tool for Scratch. We find that teachers in training (1) often start with brainstorming thematic ideas rather than setting learning objectives, (2) write code before the task text, (3) give more hints in their task texts and create fewer bugs when supported by LitterBox, and (4) mention both positive aspects of the tool and suggestions for improvement. These findings provide an improved understanding of how to inform teacher training with respect to support needed by teachers when creating programming tasks.  © 2023 ACM.}},

In Ireland, CT is not part of the primary school curriculum or mandatory in secondary schools. However, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is in the process of revising the primary school curriculum to include aspects of CT. Our aim for creating this CT Obstacle Course is to introduce teachers (and pupils) without formal computer science training to the subject of CT. This is done in a manner that informs and motivates, and gives them the confidence to deliver CT materials in the classroom. We also want to find out from teachers how useful and important this type of resource is for developing problem-solving skills, and if our unplugged activity can support learning at various skill levels. Our CT Obstacle Course includes 14 Bebras tasks for primary schools and an additional 6 Bebras tasks for secondary schools. The activity is suitable for indoors and outdoors and is completed in groups, promoting teamwork and communication. We have delivered it to 146 primary school classes during 38 school visits between May 2021 and June 2022. It has been undertaken by 3,445 pupils and 195 teachers and other school staff.

  abstract = {We present an empirical evaluation of immersion and self-avatars as compared to desktop viewing in Virtual Reality (VR) for learning computer programming and computational thinking in middle school education using an educational VR simulation. Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students' attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.}},

While literature on computing education is vast, it remains unexplored how existing CT conceptualisations relate to the learning opportunities needed for a meaningful application of coding in non-Computer Scientists’ lives and careers. In order to identify and organise the learning opportunities in the literature about CT, we conducted a configurative literature review of studies published on Web of Science, between 2006 and 2021. Our sample gathers 34 papers and was analysed on NVivo to find key themes. We were able to organise framings of CT and related learning opportunities into three dimensions: functional, collaborative, and critical and creative. These dimensions make visible learning opportunities that range from individual cognitive development to interdisciplinary working with others, and to active participation in a technologically evolving society. By comparing and contrasting frameworks, we identify and explain different perspectives on skills. Furthermore, the three-dimensional model can guide pedagogical design and practice in coding courses. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

Analyses included the distribution of correct decomposition item responses, confirmatory factor analysis, and item-level error analysis. Results indicate wide variability in students' performance on the decomposition assessment items as well as in performance on items contextualized within mathematics.

Through a case study with 1200 students and 60 teachers on IoT and smart things, we describe the workshop and the resulting designs. While the students managed to design their own artifacts, more time had been needed for covering ethical aspects related to technology design. The results suggest creating separate workshops for different grade levels, and also for design and ethical aspects respectively.

  abstract = {Young people are surrounded by machine learning (ML) devices and their lived experiences are increasingly shaped by the ML technologies that are ever-present in their lives. As innovations in machine learning technologies continue to shape society, it raises important implications for what young people learn, their career trajectories, and the required literacies they need to thrive in this changing occupational environment. Youth are particularly vulnerable to the impact of ML and very little has been done to empower them to critically engage in the discourse surrounding the next generation of technologies that have a marked potential to shape their lives for better or worse. My dissertation work seeks to develop youth autonomy and agency around ML by designing an intervention that supports youth critical use, examination, and production of ML applications in the context of promoting self-expression and social good. I will conduct a qualitative single case study research and collect multiple forms of data using interviews, story completions, digital artifacts, observations, and focus group discussions. These data sources will allow me to conduct an intensive analysis and investigation of how youth populations can be supported to develop the skills, practices and critical consciousness needed to effectively engage with machine learning technologies. Through my research, I also hope to advance the literature on how young people creatively collaborate with ML and use ML for self-expression. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

Specifically, this study examined the influence of a novel, systematic and micro instructional strategy that is grounded in abstraction and comprised of four independent but related processes – discover, extract, create, and assemble (DECA) towards simplification of problem-solving. Subsidiary questions explored the effects of students’ age, gender, computer proficiency, and prior programming experience on the development of CT. No significant difference was found between the CT skill and programming knowledge of the groups at the posttest. However, within-group paired t-tests showed that the experimental group that integrated DECA had significant improvement in CT but not in the control group across the pretest-posttest axis.

Research faculty from the CS and Teacher Education departments designed block-based programming activities for K-2 students to explore and make sense of place value representations of the numbers 1 - 1000. In-service elementary teachers in an online graduate STEM CT course (N = 13) experienced these activities as learners and provided feedback for redesign from their perspectives as classroom teachers. Qualitative analysis of collaborative problem-solving slides and individual reflections revealed how teachers connected their mathematical knowledge for teaching place value to their emergent understanding of CT concepts of abstraction, decomposition, and debugging.

Though there has been much research and innovation in recent years to help reduce high failure rates, a substantial population of students still struggle in a typical CS1 course. In this paper we create an argument of validity of the Placement Skills Inventory (PSIv1). The goal of the PSIv1 is to help advise and place students into an appropriate introductory computing course. While placement exams have been developed in the past, the goal of PSIv1 is to differentiate students who will be successful in a CS1 course and those that would be better served taking a CS0 course as their first computing course. In contrast, traditional placement exams have focused on differentiating students between CS1 and CS2. The PSIv1 is a combination of two instruments, the Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test and the Second Computer Science 1 Exam Revised Version 2. These two instruments measure students' computation thinking skills and prior programming knowledge respectively. The PSIv1 was administered to all students enrolled in either a CS0 or CS1 during the first two weeks of the semester. We use Item Response Theory to create an argument of validity of the PSIv1 and look at differences in scores on the PSIv1 based on if a student passed or failed a CS0 and CS1 course.

However, little is known about the types of problems for which Copilot does not perform well, or about the natural language interactions that a student might have with Copilot when resolving errors. We explore these questions by evaluating the performance of Copilot on a publicly available dataset of 166 programming problems.

While work has been done at the undergraduate and high school level, less is known about elementary students, and even less about Latinx students. We sought to explore the connections between Latinx elementary students' coding attitudes and computational thinking (CT) skills after participating in a year-long, remote computing curriculum in a public school district in Southern California. We collected validated measures on coding attitudes and CT skills for 164 fourth-grade students. We used structural equation modeling to analyze the relationship between the coding attitude constructs (i.e., confidence, utility, perception of coders, social influences, and interest) and scores on a CT assessment while controlling for demographic factors (i.e., gender, English language fluency, free or reduced lunch status, reading and math standardized test scores). In a model demonstrating acceptable fit, only math scores were a significant predictor of CT scores and coding confidence. Confidence was found to be significantly associated with the other attitude constructs except for perception of coders. Our results indicate that confidence plays a prominent role in student computing learning, especially at a young age. Efforts to better support Latinx students in computer science should include strategies that address students' coding confidence, such as developing positive perceptions of a student's learning process (e.g., failures as learning opportunities) in specific coding skills and practices (e.g., tinkering, debugging). © 2023 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Researchers and practitioners have worked to bring computer science to all students. However, CS is still an inequitable field. When developing curricula, we must account for the importance of connecting the lives and identities of historically marginalized students with instructional materials. We examine the knowledge and experiences that elementary (age 9-10) students drew upon to implement an open-ended programming assignment about themselves. We coded the Scratch projects of 189 students to investigate what aspects of their lives students reference, and how they use various modalities in Scratch to create digital media products about themselves. In our data, we found that the most common spheres portrayed were identity, hobbies and leisure, and interests. When expressing their identities, students narrated their experiences, expressed consciousness about their skills, connected to the user via their interests, and sometimes discussed equity. Additionally, our findings add to previous literature on Scratch as an effective platform for digital media production. In particular, we found that students used dialogue, images, sound, and the title to represent their spheres of influence through programming multimedia and interactive projects. This work has implications for the development of curricula and teaching guides for upper elementary students courses on computational thinking. Spheres of influence could inform researchers on the most influential aspects of students life in a specific context, providing elements for creating culturally relevant and interest-based materials and lessons. © 2023 ACM.}},

Our dataset consists of Snap! programs written by students new to coding and evaluated by instructors using a CT rubric. We explore how to best transform these programs into low-dimensional features to allow encapsulation and repetition patterns to emerge.

  abstract = {Algorithmic media have adopted and adapted divinatory practices and vernaculars of prediction, prophecy, probability, fortune-telling and forecasting – suggesting a possible link between artificial intelligence and pre-scientific modes of speculation. Statistical thinking and magical thinking, too, can be recognised as closely correlated epistemological systems for governing societies and ways of life. In fact, primitive astrological practices of looking up at the stars may represent one of the earliest statistical projects involving sophisticated calculations and data sets. Such pattern-making techniques could even be considered precursory to machine learning. As a point of departure for exploring these eclectic relationships between stars and data, magic and machines, I use a media archaeological methodology to question the historical roles of both astrological and computational divination in mediating methods of control, surveillance and knowledge production across transforming societal contexts. This methodology is especially relevant for examining historical narratives in the field of cultural studies as it makes apparent the hyper-connectedness between objects, cultural representation and sites of hegemonic contention. My findings reveal relationships between celestial pattern recognition and efforts to exert control over and manipulate the natural environment and its populations, the historical impact of meteorological and climatological practices for predicting and influencing future events with artificial intelligence, and links between statistics and algorithmic data biases.

While diagrams are frequently employed in university computing, little is known about its applications in K-8 (ages 6-14) computing. To inform diagram design for K-8 computing, we investigated how the spatial orientation of a diagram (horizontal or vertical) influenced the extent to which K-8 teachers developed different technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) of computational thinking (CT) concepts, such as loops, conditionals, and decomposition. We found that more teachers were able to decompose a sequence of events when using a vertical diagram. While teachers in both conditions were similarly able to describe various CT concepts and aspects of TPACK, more teachers using a vertical diagram made connections between concepts, whereas more teachers using a horizontal diagram described concepts in isolation. We hope this exploration will spur future work into diagramming and more broadly, spatial reasoning in K-8 computing. © 2023 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is an emerging and multifaceted competence important to the computing era. However, despite the growing consensus that CT is a competence domain, its theoretical and empirical account remain scarce in the current literature. To address this issue, rigorous psychometric evaluation procedures were adopted to investigate the structure of CT competency, as measured by Computational Thinking Challenge (Lai, 2021a), in a large sample of 1,130 British secondary school students (Mage = 14.14 years, SDage = 1.45). Based on model comparison from an exploratory multidimensional item response theory approach, the results supported the multidimensional operationalization of CT competency. A confirmatory bi-factor item response theory model further suggested CT competency is comprised of a general CT competency factor and two specific factors for programming and non-programming problem-solving. Despite the multidimensionality, the common variance is largely explained by a primary general factor of CT competency, thus the use of a single scale score is recommended. Psychometric evaluation from the bi-factor model indicated good psychometric properties of the assessment tool. Overall, the bi-factor model provides a useful approach to investigating CT competency and serves as a robust test validation tool. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

Over the past 5 years, district leaders, school level administrators, researchers, evaluators, and educators have been involved in a large-scale Research Practice Partnership (RPP) funded by a National Science Foundation grant. Over 50 teachers in the district wrote and revised computer science lessons to be integrated into preexisting content areas. Unique to this project, many teacher leaders were developed starting with five teacher coordinators who quickly became the guiding force of the project. These coordinators were able to develop skills necessary to coordinate a large-scale Research Practice Partnership (RPP) and made it their purpose to utilize other up and coming educators within the district to maximize exposure of the project, utilize their acquired knowledge and experiences, and create sustainability. We have built the capacity for educators involved in the project to become facilitators in a variety of areas throughout the district.

Educators involved have become mentor teachers, facilitators of professional development (PD), gained exposure in national and regional conferences, and even been hired as academic supervisors in the district.

Several tools have been reported in the literature to support the development of computational thinking. This paper reports a Systematic Literature Review to present the characteristics that have made successful web systems that support the development of computational thinking in recent years and the reported limitations. Eighteen primary studies were selected where the strategies used are usually learning through lessons, practicing with exercises, working through games, and using feedback. The systems found have been used at different elementary, middle, high school, and bachelor's degree levels. Finally, the main limitations reported in using these systems were mainly the difficulty of the topics, the previous knowledge that the students should have, the attitude that the students showed and the lack of motivation. Finally, we make some recommendations to software engineering curriculum planners and programming teachers about systems for developing computational thinking.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

In this paper, two necessary approaches are addressed for the implementation of a closed-loop control system. The first approach (programming) is directly related to the software implementation and the second approach addresses the hardware instrumentation part. Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes. The product obtained from the practice is described as a temperature control which integrates a feedback signal, this system has a wide field of applications which allowed the students of the STEM Maker workshop to achieve a project related to the individual context of each one. ©2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Block programming has been suggested as a way of engaging young learners with the foundations of programming and computational thinking in a syntax-free manner. Indeed, syntax errors—which form one of two broad categories of errors in programming, the other one being logic errors—are omitted while block programming. However, this does not mean that errors are omitted at large in such environments. In this exploratory case study of a learning environment for early programming (Kodetu), we explored errors in block programming of middle school students (N = 123), using log files drawn from a block-based online. Analyzing 1033 failed executions, we found that errors may be driven by either learners’ knowledge and behavior, or by the learning environment design. The rate of error types was not associated with the learners’ and contextual variables examined, with the exception of task complexity (as defined by SOLO taxonomy). Our findings highlight the importance of learning from errors and of learning environment design. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) skills are generally regarded as a basic ability for problem-solving and are gradually filtering down to younger age groups. Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch. However, criticism suggests that this approach has potential long-term constraints on CT education. Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students' learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest. © 2018 IEEE.}},

In the financial field, credit scoring is the core of the lending industry and one of the most common risk management tools. Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8. Secondly, this paper converts these three strategies to the QUBO model and obtains the maximum final income that is consistent with the maximum under the traditional model, with an accuracy of 96.3%, 92.7%, and 89.9% for the three combination strategies, respectively.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

The insufficiency of classic phishing detection tools has become apparent as fraudsters continue to develop new strategies; these approaches mostly depend on variables such as URL character sequences, site content, and visual resemblance. The present study highlights the "Zérosdetect" approach, a quantum-powered technique for detecting phishing URLs using zero-shot learning, a robust model that makes use of both the zero-shot learning's adaptability and the computational advantageous nature of quantum computing, it mitigates the need for extensive previous knowledge of phishing URL attributes. In order to detect previously undiscovered phishing attacks, quantum neural network have been deployed to convert URL data into quantum spaces, therefore using the computational benefits of quantum systems. Quantum layers embedded inside Qnodes are a key part of the present system, calculating gradients at a faster pace, optimizing the network performance by rapidly calculating gradients, making the solution both efficient and forward-thinking.

  abstract = {Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach. © 2023 IEEE.}},

To design such a program it is necessary to have a deep knowledge about the meaning of CT and its targets. Although CT skills are of paramount importance to all (since they bring numerous advantages for problem solving activities), in our context we see them as a pre-requisite for the learning of Computer Programming (CP). In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP. The outcome, OntoCnE (that stands for Ontologia para Computação na Escola in Portuguese), made clear what shall be trained in terms of reasoning to understand programming and being able to use it to solve problems using the computer. Moreover, OntoCnE also provides a clear insight on the concepts to be taught in each scholar year, as well as, on the instruments (hereafter called Learning Resources, LR) to be used in each moment for each specific purpose. This paper aims to introduce OntoCnE and demonstrates how to use it to classify LRs aiming to build a repository from where they can be picked up in a clear way. Finally, we demonstrate, through the PathIt resource, how the characterization of a concrete LR is performed in OntoCnE.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children's education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain's learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master's Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

We consider the application of automotive MIMO radar, which traditionally synthesizes a large uniform virtual array by appropriate waveform and physical array design. We explore deliberately introducing holes into this virtual array to leverage resolution gains provided by the increased aperture. The presence of these holes requires re-thinking DOA estimation, as conventional algorithms may no longer be easily applicable and alternative techniques, such as array interpolation, may be computationally expensive. Consequently, we study sparse array geometries that permit the direct application of spatial smoothing. We show that a sparse array geometry is amenable to spatial smoothing if it can be decomposed into the sum set of two subsets of suitable cardinality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many such decompositions may exist-not all of them yielding equal identifiability or aperture. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee identifiability of a given number of targets, which gives insight into choosing desirable decompositions for spatial smoothing. This provides uniform recovery guarantees and enables estimating DOAs at increased resolution and reduced computational complexity.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

Visualizing is a data practice that permits the discovery of key content patterns, identification of computational models to be carried out to aid further analysis, and query-resolution for subject experts with precise - and historically significant - research questions. While archival data visualizations have previously been implemented as an extension of descriptive work including finding aid element counts, here we connect visualization to the work of archival outreach and access. We study how visualizations generated by groups of students working with textual and numerical dataset portions can ultimately accelerate time-sensitive uses of collections.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT.

Recently, significant strides have been made in cell type annotation of scRNA-seq data using pre-trained language models (PLMs). This method has surmounted the constraints of conventional approaches regarding precision, robustness, and generalization. However, the fine-tuning process of large-scale pre-trained models incurs substantial computational expenses. To tackle this issue, a promising avenue of research has emerged, proposing parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for PLMs. These techniques concentrate on fine-tuning only a small portion of the model parameters while attaining comparable performance. In this study, we extensively research parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for scRNA-seq cell type annotation, employing scBERT as the backbone. We scrutinize the performance and compatibility of various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methodologies across multiple datasets. Through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in cell type annotation.

Secondly, this BERT model is used to vectorize the problem to be queried and the problem text in the database. Finally, the query questions are matched with questions under the same knowledge points using vector similarity calculations with diversity correction and recommended according to the score.

These abilities, such as modeling and coding, have become crucial for a larger audience of students, not only those who wish to become software engineers or computer scientists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-Augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes.

  abstract = {This work-in-progress paper introduces an innovative approach that uses computational notebooks to teach Finite Element Analysis (FEA) in a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate course to aid the understanding of complex phenomena in Mechanics of Materials, and enhance students' computational thinking skills. Research indicates that students, irrespective of their educational level, face difficulties in grasping fundamental concepts in mechanics of materials. These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills.

  abstract = {Teachers face challenges in teaching new subjects at the early primary level. The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly. © 2023 IEEE.}},

Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity - a project - using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students' work with basic programming concepts.

Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system. © 2023 IEEE.}},

This bot, hereinafter referred to as tutorBot+, was constructed based on chatGPT3.5 and is tasked with assisting and providing timely positive feedback to students in computer science programming courses at UCSC. Methods/Analysis: The proposed method consists of four stages: (1) Immersion in the feedback and Large Language Models (LLMs) topic; (2) Development of tutorBot+ prototypes in both non-conversational and conversational versions; (3) Experiment design; and (4) Intervention and evaluation. The first stage involves a literature review on feedback and learning, the use of intelligent tutors in the educational context, as well as the topics of LLMs and chatGPT. The second and third stages detail the development of tutorBot+ in its two versions, and the final stage lays the foundation for a quasi-experimental study involving students in the curriculum activities of Programming Workshop and Database Workshop, focusing on learning outcomes related to the development of computational thinking skills, and facilitating the use and measurement of the tool's effects. Findings: The preliminary results of this work are promising, as two functional prototypes of tutorBot+ have been developed for both the non-conversational and conversational versions. Additionally, there is ongoing exploration into the possibility of creating a domain-specific model based on pretrained models for programming, integrating tutorBot+ with other platforms, and designing an experiment to measure student performance, motivation, and the tool's effectiveness. © 2023 IEEE.}},

Following the methodology provided by Kitchenham, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive overview of studies, research, and practices related to robotics education in higher education. The study focuses on identifying the most commonly used RE hardware-based platforms in academic research publications, the type of knowledge intended to be imparted, and the skills or competencies reinforced by the platforms. Within the findings we can underline that there is no exclusive platform, but rather commercial ones are used, made by the researchers themselves, and even adapted from robots that were not designed for instructional purposes. Moreover, the subjects intended to be taught were all related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and oriented to electrical engineering, electronics, robotics, and computer science professions.

  abstract = {While governments, teacher educators, and teachers recognize the importance of introducing computer science (CS) in K-12, there is limited understanding about when the teacher preparation should start and how it needs to be done. Furthermore, with the rapid expansion of digital technology in our society and the way it affects our lives, new educational frameworks for better teacher preparation have been developed, such as TPACK and CTIntegration, that situate new technologies and their role in education to meet the new societal demands. There is a larger body of research in Mathematics on how on how to prepare teachers to teach than in CS. This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In this research to practice report, we present student perceptions of a new first-year engineering programming class that was designed by informed research practices. While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled 'Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking' for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role. © 2023 IEEE.}},

In view of the fact that the traditional resource management model can't meet the demand of service grid, this paper studies the resource management model based on the principles of computational economics and the characteristics of service grid environment, and proposes a resource management model based on computational economics. Most of the traditional economic models based on econometrics are linear models. Although such a model is a powerful economic analysis tool, it also has its own defects, that is, it can not reflect a large number of nonlinear relationships in the economic system. In this paper, an artificial neural network is used to establish a national economic forecasting model.

We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach α of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering. © 2023 IEEE.}},

To aid exploration and understanding, Octave's design incorporates a high degree of liveness, highlighting the interconnection between data, computation, and visualization. We share the underlying design principles behind Octave and details about the system design and implementation. To evaluate Octave, we conducted a usability study with students studying construction. The results show that non-programmer construction students were able to learn Octave easily and were able to effectively use it to solve domain-specific problems from construction education.

Having as a horizon 2030, 6G initiatives are being deployed across the globe to further ignite the development of 6G services. At its philosophical core, 6G embodies the "human in the loop" principle. The research effort being developed towards 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications up to services and business cases. The contributions of this book to research in the field concern an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together four different computational areas: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. The book is derived from initial brainstorming that was developed during the 11th CONASENSE Symposium held in October 2021 in fortiss, Munich, Germany. Several international experts contribute to an overview of 6G key challenges, new networking trends and challenges to be overcome, and advanced 6G services. The book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges and use-cases beyond the 2030 horizon, to then continue to address the role of non-terrestrial networks and cognitive, service-centric satellite networks in future 6G services. Still with focus on 6G adaptive networking, the book continues with a debate on the need to integrate social awareness based on an interdisciplinary approach in network operations. Then, specific examples of advanced services (quantum imaging and holography; localization of the Internet of remote things) are discussed. The book is, therefore, intended to assist in developing critical thinking to back up novel networking, applications, and services towards 6G. © 2023 River Publishers. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an explorative study investigating the effects of flipped learning on the learning motivation of primary school students enrolled in a block-based programming course. Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Identifying defects at different scales is a challenge in industrial defect detection. To solve this problem, many multi-scale feature fusion networks have been proposed to improve multi-scale target detection accuracy by fusing fine-grained information from shallow networks and semantic information from deep networks. This approach requires the introduction of extraÂ parameters. Thinking from another perspective, can the accuracy of multi-scale target detection be improved by fusing the feature information under different receptive fields? For this purpose, we designed a three-layer network structure called Trident-LK Net. our model uses convolutional kernels of different sizes (31, 25, 1) in the feature extraction phase and establishes cross-fusion connections. This omits the feature fusion part and greatly reduces the network parameters while obtaining a good detection accuracy. Finally we perform experiments on the neu-det dataset and the gc10 dataset to verify the feasibility of our idea. While keeping the number of parameters to a minimum, our model achieves competitive detection results on the neu-det dataset (76.9% mAP) and optimal on the gc10 dataset (63.55% mAP).

The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers.

  abstract = {Personal health tracking devices and internet-based digital platforms with the capacity to collect, aggregate, and store data at massive scales are examples of tools that have broadened priorities in computing to include data science. In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand 'big data.' This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, 'Coding Like a Data Miner' (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of 'big data' sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The goal of this research full paper is to provide insight into most recent findings of interviews with faculty members teaching digital skills in an integrated and innovative way embedded into courses on subject didactics of a teacher education program. Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future. © 2023 IEEE.}},

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct. When the correlations between CTCs and sessions for individual groups (PDMS & RCA) were analyzed, both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in increasing scores of synchronization and all CTCs as a single construct. The accessible and the original CT curriculums were also statistically significantly effective in improving students' learning of data representation and abstraction, respectively. © 2023 IEEE.}},

In this perspective, several factors have led to the development of tools to support programming disciplines, including: (i) the persistent problems in teaching programming worldwide, (ii) the inclusion of computational thinking and programming practices in the new Basic Education Curriculum in Brazil, (iii) the need for a lightweight virtual tool that can be freely shared and used, as many available tools charge fees, and (iv) the practical application of knowledge by licentiate degree students in Computer Science, encompassing both learning theories and software development, through the evaluation of the tool. This research aims to develop and evaluate a lightweight web tool through a case study in the context of supporting feedback for programming activities in Brazilian higher education. Additionally, the study investigates whether the feedback is considered the main problem for first-year students in computer courses from the perspective of licentiate computer science students and whether their participation in the case study can improve their skills and abilities in analyzing educational tools. A total of 16 students and three professors from four disciplines participated in the case study, with an online questionnaire as the main instrument for data collection. The analysis was performed considering the collected responses' quantitative and qualitative aspects. We obtained quantitative responses through a Likert scale, while qualitative aspects were analyzed using the Discourse Unveiling Method (UDUM). Positive aspects were identified for both professors and students, providing initial evidence of the tool's potential. Moreover, the study highlighted important feedback from undergraduate Computer Science students, which provides an opportunity to apply their knowledge technically. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {Game-based learning (GBL) can motivate learners and enable them to engage in their learning experience. Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Aims and objectives/purpose/research questions: Using a foreign language is suggested to affect how we think, even reducing bias. However, the exact mechanisms of its influence are still unknown. In this project, we tested two variants of the “thinking more” mechanism driving the foreign language effect: increased cognitive reflection and greater task engagement. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed previously collected data from five experiments employing the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and/or the Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT), each administered in the native or foreign language. If the increased reflection explanation is true, the CRT score should be higher in participants using a foreign language. If the greater task engagement explanation is true, the BNT score should be higher in participants using a foreign language. Data and analysis: We report data from N = 1,288 participants who filled the CRT and N = 413 who filled the BNT. Data were analyzed using the NHST approach and its Bayesian alternative over a spectrum of liberal, default, and conservative priors. Data are publicly available at https://osf.io/m8tn9 Findings/conclusions: All the test results were nonsignificant and showed anecdotal to strong evidence that neither the CRT nor the BNT scores improved in the foreign language condition, also when controlling for proficiency. The proportion of intuitive to computational errors was also unaffected. Originality: We are the first to comprehensively test the thinking-more explanation of the foreign language effect. Significance/Implications: Our results undermine the claim that using a foreign language promotes more cognitive reflection or engagement. The foreign language effect likely has a different cause. © The Author(s) 2023.}},

  year = {2023}},
  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {Enculturation to engineering is a topic of interest to professional organizations such as ASEE or IEEE. Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1-5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1-5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model. © 2023 IEEE.}},

This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8-10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

To enhance the original YOLOv5 algorithm, the MobielNetv3 module was used as the efficient and lightweight backbone feature extraction network. Depth-separable convolution was adopted instead of standard convolution, reducing the number of network parameters by 2× 10 ^6 and increasing detection speed by 23%. Introducing BiFPN feature pyramid structure with fusion of different feature layers in neck network improves detection accuracy by 0.4%. Adding CBAM attention mechanism at the prediction end improves the feature extraction ability of the model for small target images, which further improves the detection accuracy by 0.5%. The loss function CIoU was improved to Focal EIoU in order to solve the problems of unbalanced sample datasets and vanishing IoU gradients during the training process. The experimental results exhibit that the improved algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 98.5% on the dataset, a 39% enchancment in model detection speed and a 28% reduction in model parameters, verifying that the algorithm has the advantages of high recognition accuracy and fast detection speed.

  abstract = {Computer science uses abstractions as a tool for reasoning. It is no surprise that computer science might have something valuable to lend to the world of decentralized stablecoin design, as it is a 'computing' problem. In this paper, we examine the possibility of a decentralized and capital-efficient stablecoin using smart contracts that algorithmically trade to maintain stability. By exploiting traditional abstractions from computer science, we show that a capital-efficient algorithmic stablecoin cannot be provably stable. Additionally, we provide a formal exposition of the workings of Central Bank Digital Currencies, connecting this framing to the space of possible stablecoin designs. We then discuss several outstanding conjectures from both academics and practitioners and finally highlight the regulatory similarities between money-market funds and working stablecoins. Our work builds upon the current and growing interplay between the realms of engineering and financial services, and it also demonstrates how ways of thinking as a computer scientist can aid practitioners. We believe this research is vital for understanding and developing the future of financial technology. © 2013 IEEE.}},

Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students' learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one's working memory capacity. According to the research results, one's working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students' cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students' operation span and learning performance.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Software engineering for mobile applications has its own challenges, different from when we engineer software just for desktop environments. With the emergence of smart things (including smart everyday objects embedded with connectivity, computational ability, sensors, and sometimes actuators, urban robots such as delivery and cleaning robots, smart street lighting, smart vehicles, and smart park benches, and so on) not just within the home but in public spaces, there is a need to consider software engineering challenges for software on such things. Human-centred software engineering and work on ethical behaviours in smart things will need to come together, even as we continue to understand what it takes to effectively develop software (and systems) for such emerging devices. In order to demonstrate how software (and systems) for intelligent devices in public places might be developed, findings from a quantitative survey we performed are discussed in this study. The survey was designed such that the questions focused on the socio-ethical behaviours of smart devices when interacting with people in public places. The survey was based on a supermarket scenario where the participants had to answer the different questions in the questionnaire. There were 250 participants who only completed part of the survey; of them, 60 participants finished it in full. The complete replies have been examined and analysed in this paper. To determine how people feel about employing smart technology in public places, a variety of smart devices, including robots, smart cameras, smart speakers, and smart trolleys, are utilised in the survey questions. According to the findings, more than 80 percent of respondents think it important for smart gadgets to be socially-aware and ethical in public places.General Abstract This paper examines the survey results conducted to explore if smart devices such as robots or smart cameras can be deployed in public areas. The respondents reply to survey questions asking them whether they believe it is crucial to keep smart robots, smart carts, or any other smart devices in the supermarket. The survey's questions are constructed in such a manner that participants are asked to imagine themselves as either a customer shopping for groceries at a store or a manager running the business and dealing with the friendly robot. This survey was created with the intention of thinking carefully about how intelligent software systems may be designed from the standpoint of software engineering for public settings. Later in this article, the survey findings and insights are discussed.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

STEM incorporates an interdisciplinary approach that includes inquiry, analysis, critical thinking, practical experimentation, and cooperative problem-solving. Technological advancements are offering new ways to integrate new tools such as drones, robotics and gaming in teaching and learning practices and modify the pedagogical approaches that are more appealing and engaging. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical approach and practice that integrate drone technology and block-based programming to foster students' computation thinking in a STEM context. The block-based visual programming languages provide an interactive environment to connect the blocks and write programs. The study was conducted in six Australian schools. Students were assigned projects to automate drones using the DroneBlocks app and make programs to fly the drone in different geometrical patterns; straight line, arch, rectangle, triangles and zig-zag and integrate the various manoeuvres; bounce, 8D flips, and throw & go along flight paths. Students' computational thinking development was examined with an emphasis on their performance in formulating and problem-solving.

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence technology has made remarkable progress in machine learning, but it is still in its infancy in creative thinking or computational creativity. In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles. We plan to further use this model to address complex real-world problems, such as the study of cancer therapeutic targets. © 2023 IEEE.}},

The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework.

Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9-12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6-8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs.

  abstract = {Currently we see globalization and technological advances accelerating worldwide, transforming the world of work and human coexistence. We still notice that the educational systems, in their majority, are disconnected from these global realities. In this sense, it is necessary to have an educational formation more aligned to the contemporary world, preparing young people for the challenges of the 21st century, how to deal with technological resources and processes, developing soft and hard skills. In this way, it can be observed that in recent years computational thinking has gained relevance in this scenario, being a field of research in the most varied areas of knowledge, developing communication skills, creativity, leadership, problem solving, familiarity with technologies, management, transforming young people into autonomous individuals who are prepared for the technological changes that the world requires. Taking these transformations as a reference, this paper describes/presents the development of an online tool to stimulate computational thinking in elementary school, through online games. he use of the ThinkinGame makes it possible to identify the pillars to be worked on with young people, after its use, thus improving the approaches to be given in the formation of these young people, being able to turn attention to the challenge of teaching additional skills, such as sophisticated thinking and flexible problem solving.  © 2023 Fontys University of Applied Science.}},

  abstract = {In intelligent transportation systems, accurate long-term traffic forecasting is informative for administrators and travelers to make wise decisions in advance. Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the models' strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.  © 2023 IEEE.}},

Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science.

The results show that the evaluation indicators and test questions designed on text-based programming are more consistent with the evaluation objectives.

However, the deep neural network (DNN) implementation of text non-linear systems outperforms optimal linear models. Therefore, the forward DNN (the pattern recognition system in this paper) attracts attention to the necessity of interpreting the results obtained by DNN. To preserve the high performance of DNN, we focus on a post-hoc explanation; this approach means building an explainable model for the decision obtained by the black box. To avoid the interpretation of a set of millions of non-linear functions, we divide DNN into two parts: the feature extractor and the classifier. Following that, we argue for a specific interpretation of each of them. While for classifiers, we have several suitable explainable models (and we decided on the fuzzy logical function), we believe that feature interpretation is a creative scientific activity corresponding to the usual research.

The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study's findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities.

  abstract = {This paper first presents an input-stationary (IS) implemented crossbar accelerator (INCA), supporting inference and training for deep neural networks (DNNs). Processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators for DNNs have been actively researched, specifically, with resistive random-access memory (RRAM), due to RRAM's computing and memorizing capabilities and device merits. To the best of our knowledge, all previous PIM accelerators have saved weights into RRAMs and inputs (activations) into conventional memories - it naturally forms weight-stationary (WS) dataflow. WS has generally been considered the most optimized choice for high parallelism and data reuse. How-ever, WS-based PIM accelerators show fundamental limitations: first, remaining high dependency on DRAM and buffers for fetching and saving inputs (activations); second, a remarkable number of extra RRAMs for transposed weights and additional computational intermediates in training; third, coarse-grained arrays demanding high-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and introducing poor utilization in depthwise and pointwise convolution; last, degraded accuracy due to its sensitivity to weights which are affected by RRAM's nonideality. On the other hand, we observe that IS dataflow, where RRAMs retain inputs (activations), can effectively address the limitations of WS, because of low dependency by only loading weights, no need for extra RRAMs, feasibility of fine-grained accelerator design, and less impact of input (activation) variance on accuracy. But IS dataflow is hardly achievable by the existing crossbar structure because it is difficult to implement kernel sliding and preserve the high parallelism. To support kernel movement, we constitute a cell structure with two-transistor-one-RRAM (2T1R). Based on the 2T1R cell, we design a novel three-dimensional (3D) architecture for high parallelism in batch training. Our experiment results prove the potential of INCA. Compared to the WS accelerator, INCA achieves up to 20.6× and 260× energy efficiency improvement in inference and training, respectively; 4.8× (inference) and 18.6× (training) speedup as well. While accuracy in WS drops to 15% in our high-noise simulation, INCA presents an even more robust result as 86% accuracy. © 2023 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving learners' interaction with educational computer games. Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners' performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners' final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners' actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners' performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners' action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In this work, BEAM robotics is proposed to enhance the STEM knowledge and skills of engineering students in the electrical, electronic, and mechanical domains. To evaluate the proposal, a course is designed and implemented based on a curriculum with objectives and learning activities centered on the design, construction, and operation of the BEAM robots. In addition, the connection between this proposal and computational thinking is explored. Students learn to recognize each part of robots and how they are related, abstract useful information from an electronic scheme and concretize it in a machine by systematizing their behavior. In addition, thanks to an evaluation of the behavior of the robot, identify the faults and apply the solution, as in the debugging process carried out in software programming. It should be added that BEAM robotics has a sustainable and low-cost aspect, which is used in learning activities where Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is recycled, and students are taught to value and integrate these parts into the design of the robots. A pre and post survey and a respective statistical analysis and evaluation of curricular activities are presented as evidence of the improvement observed in students’ STEM knowledge and skills. In general, the results show that this new teaching tool can promote the STEM curriculum in engineering students and motivate implementation, as a new educational robot, at other academic levels such as secondary and pre-secondary education. © 2022, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered an essential problem-solving skill in the 21st century, and is receiving attention on different educational levels. To promote and assess students' CT skills, so-called 'Bebras tasks' (i.e. small tasks for problem solving in informatics) are created by experts in the field of CT. There has not been empirical research to determine to what extent and how CT skills are used while solving these tasks, however. This qualitative study bridges this gap by using the think-Aloud method to examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras. The results of this study can serve as a validation for the use of CT skills in solving Bebras tasks. This poster abstract introduces the background and setup of the study.  © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

  journal = {International Journal of Architectural Computing}},
  abstract = {In a problem-based, digital-intensive learning environment, the increased proliferation of computational tools used for architectural design has led to a fundamental transformation in architectural studios. Many studies have shown that this has significantly led to the change in cognition of design environments in academia. Design decisions are made through a recursive process that is cyclically refined by allowing constant feedback and testing. This paper represents an observational study with an aim to understand the impact of digital mediums on design processes and design outcomes focusing on associative modeling using VPL. It contextualizes the difference, the associative modeling system as a parametric subset brings to design thinking when used as a medium to explore architectural design. It analyzes specific attributes of associative modeling, otherwise native to computational thinking, that contribute to the legibility of the design process. The paper demonstrates how associative modeling allows the design process to be examined and edited at any stage during and even after algorithmic development, bringing in flexibility. It is argued that digital design tool affordances enable students to develop multilayered and more structured design logic that augments cognition bringing more legibility to the design thinking process. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

This chapter discusses about various developments in the amalgamation of neuroscience and AI, and the prospects in the near future. The nervous system is a complex system which is divided into central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. These systems are regulated by chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. The function of the brain can be analyzed with the help of various mathematical and computational models. The detection of neurotransmitters is done by using biosensors and machine learning. This amalgamation of neuroscience and AI proves to be very useful for the treatment and detection of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders.

Programming curriculum emphasizes computational thinking, which is the capacity to analyze, design algorithms, and find solutions to programming problems. However, it is not easy to develop students' computational thinking abilities. In addition, students' poor learning attitudes are connected to difficulties in learning programming. Therefore, it is crucial for educators to investigate how to improve students' computational thinking and learning attitudes. This study applied a quasi-experimental research method to a single group and used a pretest-posttest method to measure the influence of using Code.org on computational thinking and learning attitudes. The participants were 20 third-grade students in an elementary school in Macao. The teaching duration is carried out for three weeks, six lessons per week, a total of eighteen lessons, and 40 minutes per lesson. The Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS) and the Attitude Scale of Computer Programming Learning (ASCOPL) were used to evaluate the implementation's effect. After analyzing the questionnaire scores and students' achievements on the Code.org website, it was found that after receiving the Code.org instruction, students were able to complete most of the stage of the Course B curriculum in Code.org, and their computational thinking and learning attitudes have improved significantly.  © 2022 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Problem. K-12 teachers face many challenges when teaching a new subject like computer science (CS). They are often far removed from the research being conducted to identify evidence-driven solutions to these challenges. Likewise, researchers are also often removed from the challenges of classroom practices that teachers face when teaching CS.Research Questions. To create a collaborative process for teachers and researchers outside of a research practice partnership, we piloted a facilitated process in which CS middle school teachers and CS education researchers collaboratively created CS teacher practice briefs. Our research question for this study was: In what ways are teachers impacted by the process of creating teacher practice briefs in collaboration with researchers?Methodology. We conducted a qualitative study, using a semi-structured interview protocol to interview five teachers and three researchers to gain an understanding of how this process impacted the participants. We used thematic content analysis to identify several subthemes across our pre-established themes: motivation for teachers to participate, impacts on teachers, perceived impacts on students, and impacts on researchers.Findings. We found that the impact on teachers mirrored impacts found on teachers who engage in Research Practice Partnerships, including increased self-efficacy, expanded professional networks, and changed classroom practices.Implications. By bringing researchers and educators together with a clear focus on equity-based problems of practice in CS education, the results display a multitude of positive impacts. Teachers indicate that they are are positively impacted, researchers develop a clear understanding of realistic practices, and students are peripherally impacted through changed practices in the classroom. Therefore, the most significant contribution to advance the disciplinary understanding is the potential for this new process to decrease the gap between research and practice.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

A timely detection of these issues is challenging but crucial, since it could open the possibility to offer help to people before the illness gets worse. One alternative to accomplish this is to monitor how people express themselves, that is for example what and how they write, or even a step further, what emotions they express in their social media communications. In this article, we analyze two computational representations that aim to model the presence and changes of the emotions expressed by social media users. In our evaluation we use two recent public data sets for two important mental disorders: Depression and Anorexia. The obtained results suggest that the presence and variability of emotions, captured by the proposed representations, allow to highlight important information about social media users suffering from depression or anorexia. Furthermore, the fusion of both representations can boost the performance, equalling the best reported approach for depression and barely behind the top performer for anorexia by only 1 percent. Moreover, these representations open the possibility to add some interpretability to the results.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.}},

It notes that analytical and computational thinking, data literacy, information literacy, social intelligence, programs and project management, cross-cultural competency, transliteracy, transdisciplinary, design thinking and mindset, virtual collaboration and cognitive load management are skills to be possessed by smart librarians. It highlights cloud computing, big data, 3D printing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, RFID, drones etc., as the emerging technologies used for smart libraries and further discusses smart services, smart people, smart places and smart governance as the dimensions of smart library. Revelations are further made that smart libraries aid space saving, expansion of library working hours and services and promotes access to information, while remarks are made that lack of technological know-how, technophobia, data privacy and security, etc., are the challenges of smart library. It concludes that the emergence of smart library have facilitated the redefinition of library services and operations and recommends amongst others that librarians should continuously update their skills so that they can meet up with competitions that may arise from the challenges of globalisation of the information landscape. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It is an annual competition designed to showcase college students' innovative ability, team spirit and ability to write programs, and analyze and solve problems under pressure. Aiming at the main problems existing in traditional C++ curriculum teaching, a live code teaching method and an ACM/ICPC innovation model are proposed in this paper that highlights the "student-centered"teaching concept. By taking the "problem-solving"as the main line of teaching, the "live code"as the teaching method, and the informatization teaching as the means, the ACM/ICPC competition promotes the integration of the students' theory and practice. The results of more than ten years of practical teaching show that the proposed live code pedagogy and the ACM/ICPC-based reform have effectively cultivated the students' programming interest and computational thinking, and significantly improved their programming and innovation abilities. At present, the live code teaching method and the ACM/ICPC innovation model have been effectively promoted and applied in the three campuses of our university, as they have a certain leading and exemplary role in cultivating strong professional programming skills, computational thinking, global vision and the all-round development of top-notch innovative talents in the computer field.  © 2022 ACM.}},

The students had experienced popular speech recognition usage in their daily life, such as Siri and Google Assistant; therefore, this study developed instructional material for university freshmen to learn to develop their own artificial intelligence (AI) application (app) on a smart phone with PAC in MIT App Inventor. The PAC platform and the learning material cultivated students to train their own voice classification model, which is a form of supervised machine learning in the AI domain. The results showed that both groups, who had successfully trained computers to distinguish received voice commands with PAC receiving the human voice spectrogram via the cloud platform developed by MIT, made significant progress in their learning effectiveness in AI education. When the students employed the AI app on smartphones in the CT board game, the students’ voice commands could be classified, and then the corresponding command could be executed through the program to control the action of the robot car on the map, regardless of whether they were competing or not. This study not only successfully provided the students with simple AI learning material, but also cultivated their creative thinking, as identified in the survey of the computational thinking self-efficacy scale. During the process of completing a mobile phone application with AI, students should know and use the function of voice classification to achieve goals and expand their cognition of AI applications.

In the first phase, 37 experts evaluated the validity of the cCTt through a survey and focus group. In the second phase, the test was administered to 1519 students. We employed Classical Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to assess the instruments’ psychometric properties. The expert evaluation indicates that the cCTt shows good face, construct, and content validity. Furthermore, the psychometric analysis of the student data demonstrates adequate reliability, difficulty, and discriminability for the target age groups. Finally, shortened variants of the test are established through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. To conclude, the proposed cCTt is a valid and reliable instrument, for use by researchers and educators alike, which expands the portfolio of validated CT assessments across compulsory education.

We conducted a mixed methods case study with a sequential design to explore adolescents’ self-efficacy and engagement in computational practices, along with practices in several disciplines of science and engineering. In partnership with two eighth-grade environmental science teachers in a culturally and linguistically diverse urban-ring city of the Northeast US, students (N = 199) worked in teams to design, assemble, and code for “smart”, or automated, miniature greenhouses. We report on successes in engagement, along with tensions in self-efficacy, namely relating to generality, social factors, and emotive sources. Specifically, we elaborate on tensions related to (1) engagement via fun and camaraderie vs. disaffection per anxiety and stress; (2) practices as sequential vs. simultaneous; (3) prior experience with coding vs. present application; and (4) disciplinary pre-conceptions vs. expansion. We conclude with implications for educational design of pluridisciplinary spaces, especially for those including computation, and which seek to leverage interest and engagement to develop self-efficacy. Also, we discuss how our study extends self-efficacy theory through its finer-grained analyses with more diverse participants.

  abstract = {This intervention advances glitches as epistemological vectors for apprehending and engaging the significance of digitally-mediated spatialities that appear nonperformative against normative scripts of urban computational paradigms. Drawing on two strands of contemporary thinking about glitches as systemic design features of digital systems and as generative fissures within them, we mobilize a queer orientation that stays with the generative tensions of urban spatialities that present as idiosyncratic and as interrupting. We mobilize this epistemological approach through illustrative U.S. based examples of seemingly abandoned shared e-bikes, performatively ‘ugly’ homes, and wilful property dilapidation wrought through the registers of desire and aesthetics. In so doing, we show how glitch empistemologies render visible how the technocapitalist manufacturing of normative spatial desires for particular kinds of urban sociospatialities and aesthetic visual signatures are both secured and interrupted on digitally-mediated and -mediatized terrains. Glitch epistemologies establish the significance of small-scale disorientations in digital urban mediations, engaging these nonperformativities and non-computes as unexceptional openings onto everyday possibilities for politics in computational cities. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

  abstract = {The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on education has opened new doors and accelerated change, and a learning opportunity has emerged towards the digital transformation of teaching models. Computing acquires a new relevance and fits into the plan to strengthen digital skills as a driver of digital knowledge, particularly relevant for children and young people. In parallel, both the close contact with computers allows the development of skills such as logical reasoning, critical thinking, creativity, communication and teamwork, and the very coexistence of citizens with digital technologies requires the prior acquisition of this knowledge, in order to be prepared to meet the new demands of modern society. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an ongoing research project that aims at developing young children’s expression through embodied computing in order to enhance their digital knowledge, by adapting the digital manipulative (DM) Mobeybou for storytelling and narrative creation as a tool for promoting computational thinking (CT) and inherent competences through a bodily expression experience. The educational toolkit and base literature review are discussed, and the early prototypes of the programming language proposed are presented, as well as the ongoing and future work. With this initial work it was possible to conclude that computer programming has many benefits in fostering CT in children, alongside other cognitive skills, as well as the importance of stimulating children’s expression and communication that are transversal to all areas of life. Therefore, computer programming will be used and incorporated in Mobeybou in order to achieve the research aims proposed in this paper and promote children’s expression through CT development. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

  abstract = {Social-emotional skills and computational thinking are related to problem-solving skills. Even though these are crucial areas in today's world, they are only rarely taught in school and interventions that target these areas simultaneously are still very rare. We therefore developed a four-day workshop with the aim of fostering computational thinking and social-emotional skills in Grade 4 students. To do so, we used the child-friendly programming language Scratch. In the present paper, we investigate the feasibility of such a workshop. In total, 18 students participated. Data was collected via observation and interviews and analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results showed that students liked working with Scratch and liked working on social-emotional challenges. The workshop was found to work well and students worked independently. Pair work activity was found to be particularly beneficial. Although some issues initially proved challenging (mostly relating to "how to"issues in Scratch), these may easily be addressed by making suitable adaptations to the introduction of the program provided on Day 1 of the workshop.  © 2022 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Applications with adaptability are widely available on the edge devices with energy harvesting capabilities. For their runtime quality optimization, however, current approaches cannot tackle the variations of quality modeling and harvested energy simultaneously. Therefore, in this article, we are the first to propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) method that optimizes the application execution quality of energy harvesting edge devices to mitigate the variations. First, we propose a baseline DRL formulation that novelly migrates the objective of quality maximization into a reward function and constructs a DRL quality agent. Second, we devise a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based selector that performs DRL quality agent selection based on the energy harvesting history. Third, we further propose two optimization methods to alleviate the nonnegligible overhead of DRL computations: 1) an improved thinking-while-moving concurrent DRL scheme to compromise the 'state drifting' issue during the DRL decision process and 2) a variable interstate duration decision scheme that compromises the DVFS overhead incurred in each action taken. The experiments take an adaptive stereo matching application as a case study. The results show that the proposed DRL-based DVFS method on average achieves 17.9% runtime reduction and 22.05% quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art solutions.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.}},

This study examines identity development of upper elementary multilingual students as they engage in a year-long computational thinking curriculum, and follows their engagement across multiple settings (i.e., school, club, home, community). Findings from pre- and post-surveys of identity showed significant differences favoring students' experiences with computer science, their perceptions of computer science, their perceptions of themselves as computer scientists, and their family support for computer science. Findings from follow-up interviews and prior research suggest that tailored instruction provides opportunities for connections to out-of-school learning environments with friends and family that may shift students' perceptions of their abilities to pursue computer science and persist when encountering challenges. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking.

  abstract = {Skylight polarized patterns provide fresh thinking for the human to use the information sources in nature for orientation, but this orientation method is susceptible to weather conditions. Especially, in the case of cloudy weather, the cloud directly leads to the decline of orientation precision. In this article, a robust bionic polarized skylight orientation method based on the model consistency of polarization patterns (MCOPPs) is proposed for cloudy weather. First, we made full use of the DOP information to preprocess the polarization information as an aid to the subsequent polarization light orientation. Then, based on the vertical feature of the E-vector of the polarized light and the scattering plane, we developed the MCOPP error criterion and proposed a two-step optimizing framework for the effective selection of the interior points. Finally, the outdoor static rotating experiment and the dynamic vehicle experiment are conducted for evaluating our algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that MCOPP can realize an effective and robust polarized orientation under cloudy conditions, and the accuracy of orientation in the outdoor static experiment is within 0.5° and in the dynamic car experiment is within 0.7°. Compared with the other four classic methods, the RMSE of the orientation error can be decreased by 50.6% in the outdoor static experiment and by 46.0% in the dynamic vehicle experiment. Especially, the proposed MCOPP has lower computational complexity than the existing robust polarized skylight method.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The rising interest of educators, researchers, and policymakers around the world as far as the development of computational thinking skills in compulsory education is concerned is echoed in the plethora of research studies discussed in the pertinent literature. However, the successful injection of computation thinking in formal educational settings demands the construction of developmentally appropriate assessment tools. In this paper, we discuss a novel framework for assessing computational thinking skills in early childhood settings. The proposed framework was employed in a relevant quantitative research study conducted in the city of Heraklion, Crete, from February to June 2019, with a sample of 435 first and second graders and within the context of the Environmental Study course. This paper also provides evidence regarding the examination of age, gender, and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course as predictive factors of one of the core computational thinking competencies, namely algorithmic thinking. The research findings revealed that age and learning achievements in the Environmental Study course constitute predictive factors for algorithmic thinking skills in the first and second grade level of primary school. On the contrary, algorithmic thinking skills are not related to first and second graders’ gender.

  abstract = {Computational thinking is increasingly introduced at primary school level, usually with some form of programming activity. In particular, educational robots provide an opportunity for engaging students with programming through hands-on experiences. However, primary school teachers might not be adequately prepared for teaching computer science related topics, and giving feedback to students can often be challenging: Besides the content of the feedback (e.g., what problems have to be handled), the way the feedback is given is also important, as it can lead to negative emotional effects. To support teachers with the way of giving feedback on common problems when teaching programming with robotics, we conducted a study consisting of seven workshops with three third and four fourth grade primary school classes. Within seven different activities, the 116 primary school children first programmed the Ozobot Evo robot in the pen-and-paper mode and then on a digital device. Throughout these activities we collected data on the problems the students encountered, the feedback given, and the fun they experienced. Our analysis reveals eight categories of problems, which we summarise in this paper together with corresponding possible feedback. We observed that problems that are urgent or can harm the students' self-efficacy have a negative impact on how enjoyable an activity is perceived. While direct instruction significantly decreased the experienced fun, hints had a positive effect. Generally, we found programming the Ozobot Evo to be encouraging for both girls and boys. To support teachers, we discuss ideas for giving encouraging feedback on common problems of Ozobot Evo programming activities and how our findings transfer to other robots.  © 2022 ACM.}},

Next, the items were piloted on a sample of 289 participants, 137 experts in CT, and 152 novices. After a series of confirmatory factor analyses, a unidimensional model that represents algorithmic thinking was adopted. Further analyzing the psychometric quality of the 27 items, 20 of them with excellent reliability indices were selected for the test. Thus, this study provides a tool to evaluate adults’ CT: the Algorithmic Thinking Test for Adults (ATTA), which was developed according to psychometric standards.

  abstract = {In Computer Science (CS), modeling with diagrams is a well-known practice to visualize complex software systems or database structures. However, modeling with e.g., entity-relationship diagrams or UML (Unified Modeling Language) is also helpful in other disciplines. In this research, CS models are used as a teaching and learning tool in foreign language acquisition. The field of computer science offers a variety of models that can visualize states, as well as processes and, are therefore very suitable for the different areas of language teaching (e.g., reading, writing, grammar-, or vocabulary acquisition). With CS modeling as a teaching and learning strategy, two main objectives are addressed: enhancing learning and retention and fostering computational thinking skills. This paper presents best practice examples on how to meet these two objectives as well as the results of a crossover study, where we investigated whether vocabulary acquisition is facilitated when it is thematically preorganized in class diagrams. The results illustrate that pupils who studied with the class diagram strategy had significantly higher recall performance than pupils who studied with the list of words. A qualitative analysis of the participants' feedback after the intervention revealed decisive criteria for their preferences regarding the learning format.  © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

The subjects were 75 college students from two classes, which were divided into student-selected and heterogeneous groups, and took the experimental programming course for three weeks. The pre-Test and post-Test learning outcomes were validate by t-Test and one-way ANOVA. This experiment aimed to understand the learning outcomes after adopting grouping strategies, as well as the learning outcomes of students with different backgrounds after adopting grouping strategies. The results showed that both student-selected grouping and heterogeneous grouping can improve the learning outcome. The learning outcome with student-selected grouping is business management background > other backgrounds > design background > electrical engineering and computer science background. With heterogeneous grouping, the learning outcome of the design background is close to that of the electrical engineering and computer science background, and there is no significant difference among electrical engineering and computer science, business management, and other learning backgrounds. Thus, the learning outcome with heterogeneous grouping is better than that with student-selected grouping.  © 2022 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Today's teaching and didactical methods are trying more and more to integrate digital technologies and computational thinking (CT) into other subjects. One way of combining and integrating these important skills and CT into all subjects, school levels, and school types is to include the game Poly-Universe (PolyUni). According to the results of the Poly-Universe in School Education (PUSE) study 2018, the game can be expected to have a positive effect on visual perceptual progress, including isolation and the development of shape-background skills. So far, however, comparatively few attempts have been made to explore the educational possibilities of PolyUni for different school levels and subjects, besides mathematics. This research explores how PolyUni can be used to promote CT and to evaluate whether the learning objectives in the subjects of physical education and biology have been achieved. Furthermore, it examines how PolyUni combines the requirements of the different curricula in secondary school, based on self-designed tasks. Additionally, further aspects PolyUni can promote besides the curriculum in secondary school are discussed. To explore the above-mentioned aspects, a mixed-methods study methodology was used. The participant observation method was employed for qualitative data collection, and a self-designed assessment grid and additional picture analysis were used for the quantitative data. The game was utilized in two workshops for biology and physical education at an Austrian secondary school, and fifty-six students were observed and analyzed. Based on the present data, it can be assumed that PolyUni helps to achieve the requirements of the curricula and pre-defined teaching and learning objectives in a playful way. Furthermore, the game not only promotes CT in secondary school but also encourages enjoyment and collaboration between peers in biology and physical education lessons.  © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

Creating a computationally literate workforce capable of recognizing and eliminating algorithmic discrimination requires diverse perspectives and lived experiences. Your Voice is Power is a 5-class period curriculum targeted for K-12 audiences that seeks to promote racial equity and increase interest in computing careers by integrating elements of computing, music, social justice, and entrepreneurship. Centering around the song “Entrepreneur” by Pharrell Williams, students engage in lyrical analysis to extract and explore themes of social justice using the OUTKAST Imagination framework. Students then engage with musical concepts from a computing perspective and implement them using EarSketch, a web-based, learn-to-code through music remixing platform developed at Georgia Tech. In this paper, we present a description of the Your Voice is Power Curriculum and results from an evaluation study. The curriculum overview includes a description of the content and activities, as well as a discussion of the frameworks and theories underlying the curriculum's development. We also present results from a program evaluation covering both a pilot and a full implementation of this newly developed curriculum during the 2020-2021 academic year. Participating high school students and teachers were recruited to respond to online surveys regarding their awareness of and interest in computing, music, and social justice, and their experiences in the competition. Teachers felt that competition participation conferred a variety of benefits to their students and expressed positive attitudes around the social justice focus of the curriculum. Students provided largely positive feedback on the competition and reported a positive impact on their understanding of social justice and equity. Students also demonstrated high levels of understanding of the ubiquity of coding skills and applications. Taken together, program evaluation results show that this integration of themes is effective in engaging students in difficult conversations about race while building interest in computing. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.}},

The University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) charged a task force with defining the computing education needs for their students. The task force conducted a year long process involving searches of courses and programs, interviews with students and faculty, and a large survey. The task force proposed themes of Computing for Discovery, Expression, and Justice as useful in organizing computing within the liberal arts and sciences. We are now designing the introductory courses for expression and justice. We are using participatory design methods where faculty advisors engage in tasks (like card sorting) to define projects and learning goals. The expression and justice card sorts are markedly different. We are planning to use a block-based language (Snap!) for instruction and homework, but students will also engage with a purpose-built Runestone ebook in a textual language like Processing (for expression), and Python and HTML (for justice).

Unfortunately, there are relatively few primary/elementary school teachers who have received formal training in computer science, and they often self-report a lack of CS subject matter expertise. Teacher development is a key factor to address these issues, and this paper describes professional development strategies and empirical impacts of a summer institute that included two graduate courses and a series of Saturday workshops during the subsequent academic year. Key elements included teaching a high-level programing language (Python and JavaScript), integrating CS content and pedagogy instruction, and involving both experienced K-12 CS teachers and University faculty as instructors. Empirical results showed that this carefully structured PD that incorporated evidence-based elements of sufficient duration, teacher active learning and collaboration, modeling, practice, and feedback can successfully impact teacher outcomes. Results showed significant gains in teacher CS knowledge (both pedagogy and content), self-efficacy, and perception of CS value.

  journal = {Textile Research Journal}},
  abstract = {The design of metallic card clothing, which is one of the most important devices in the textile industry, has always been based on operational experience. With the development of types of fibers and the requirements for the quality of yarns, those principles concluded by engineers seem to be losing their efficiency. Recent research found that airflow played an important role in the card process, which means airflow should be carefully studied. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation greatly helps in the analysis of airflow because the gauge between carding elements is too narrow to put in any measuring device. In the present study, with the help of CFD simulation, the air around different carding clothing with varied tooth depth was analyzed. It was concluded that the carding efficiency improvement in card clothing with lower tooth depth may be related to more concentrated air velocity at the tooth tips. This resulted in more probabilities that fibers would get through the cylinder surface at the teeth tips, so that the fibers could be caught by flat-top needles more efficiently. With this assumption, a new generation of card clothing called “double teeth” containing two teeth in a single section has been invented. The new configuration design of card clothing was then applied in several spinning mills on an industrial scale for experiments. The results showed about a 30% improvement in production at the same quality level as conventional card clothing, which implied the usefulness of the newly applied principles related to airflow. Despite the difficulty in the study of the complex carding process, the new airflow analysis method has shown an optional and worthwhile way of thinking that could make a difference in future research in the textile industry. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has proposed a revised primary mathematics curriculum with an emphasis on CT skills and problem solving, and some teachers would like to introduce it already on an informal basis. However, CT is not yet part of teacher training. Our motivating question has been: how can teachers without a computer science background deliver CT at primary level in Ireland? Our process involves third-level computer science academics co-creating resources with in-service and pre-service teachers during workshops. The resources comprise a workbook and lesson plans. Our resources are based on tasks from the International Bebras Challenge, a well-known large-scale international CT contest with a reasonably gender-neutral profile of school-age participants. The workbook consists of ten Bebras tasks, each followed by a page of original activities on the theme of the task. A set of ten lesson plans accompanies the workbook. Each lesson plan has information about how to use the corresponding workbook activities in the classroom, where the activity might fit into the existing curriculum, categorisation of the task in terms of eight CT topics, differentiation, and extension activities. This paper explains our process of workshop planning, workbook creation, and lesson plan co-creation. Preliminary evaluation of our process uses teacher feedback.  © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

Results indicated that the children aged 6–8 years old could classify things according to two kinds of criteria at the same time, but their cognitive style was still ego-centered and they found it difficult to deal with problems from a third-party perspective, no matter whether in the treatment group or the control group. However, students in the treatment group achieved significantly higher scores on the test of computational thinking and were more engaged in the classroom interaction patterns. These findings provide evidence of the positive effect of the UPTA on promoting children’s computational thinking by guiding them to decompose and solve problems, as well as enhancing their interaction and communication in the classroom, so as to transform from simple imitation to collaborative inquiry. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

However, without further guidance, students might focus on learning the syntax of computer programming language rather than the concept of solving problems. This study proposes a peer-assessment-supported PFCT (PA-PFCT) approach for boosting students’ computer programming knowledge and computational thinking awareness. A quasi-experiment was conducted on a computer programming course in a high school to evaluate its influence on students’ learning achievement, computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy. An experimental group of 51 students learned with the proposed approach, while a control group of 49 students learned with the traditional PFCT (T-PFCT) approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the students’ computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy, while not having significant impacts on their computer programming knowledge test scores. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

  abstract = {Background and Context. With increasing efforts to bring computing education opportunities into elementary schools, there is a growing need for assessments, with arguments for validity, to support research evaluation at these grade levels. After successfully piloting a 10-question computational thinking assessment (Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students - ACES) for 4th graders in Spring 2020, we used our analyses of item difficulty and discrimination to iterate on the assessment. Objectives. To increase the number of potential items for ACES, we created isomorphic versions of existing questions. The nature of the changes varied from incidental changes that we did not believe would impact student performance to more radical changes that seemed likely to influence question difficulty. We sought to understand the impact of these changes on student performance. Method. Using these isomorphic questions, we created two versions of our assessment and piloted them in Spring 2021 with 235 upper-elementary (4th grade) students. We analyzed the reliability of the assessments using Cronbach's alpha. We used Chi-squared tests to analyze questions that were identical across the two assessments to form a baseline of comparison and then ran Chi-Squared and Kruskal-Wallis H tests to analyze the differences between the isomorphic copies of the questions. Findings. Both assessment versions demonstrated good reliability, with identical Cronbach's alphas of 0.868. We found statistically similar performance on the identical questions between our two groups of students, allowing us to compare their performance on the isomorphic questions. Students performed differently on the isomorphic questions, indicating the changes to the questions had a differential impact on student performance. Implications. This paper builds on existing work by presenting methods for creating isomorphic questions. We provide valuable lessons learned, both on those methods and on the impact of specific types of changes on student performance.  © 2022 Owner/Author.}},

The results showed that the final CTT-ES including 16 items had a good fitness, discrimination, and reliability to evaluate elementary students’ domain-general CT competencies. The convergent validity of CTT-ES was confirmed by its significant correlations with the CTS scores. The significant regression model not only showed students’ CT competencies can be predicted by their CT dispositions but also supported The Developmental Model of CT.

To address this issue, the current article describes a novel approach towards understanding the ontological aspects of CT by using text mining and graph-theoretic techniques to elucidate teachers’ perspectives collected in an online survey (N = 105). In particular, a hierarchical cluster analysis, a knowledge representation method, was applied to identify sub-groups in CT conceptualization and assessment amongst teachers. Five clusters in conceptualization and two clusters in assessment were identified; several relevant and distinct themes were also extracted. The results suggested that teachers attributed CT as a competence domain, relevant in the problem- solving context, as well as applicable and transferrable to various disciplines. The results also shed light on the importance of using multiple approaches to assess the diversity of CT. Overall, the findings collectively contributed to a comprehensive and multi-perspective representation of CT that refine both theory and practice.

To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students' CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third-and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students' CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants' (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students' CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs.

Although reusing reclaimed material can significantly reduce the environmental impact in building construction, current design processes are not set up for this shift in thinking. Contrary to conventional practices, designing within the constraints of available material means that geometry and topology cannot be fully pre-determined. This paper introduces a design methodology for corrugated shell structures from folded sheet metal of variable geometries and properties, in which the design goal adapts to available material. It follows a two-fold approach of digital algorithm development and scanning and physical prototyping for robotic fabrication. The scanned materials database is classified based on object geometry data and material properties; such as thickness, type of metal, and spring-back values for fabrication purposes. Together with a target surface, it is an input for a generative design algorithm consisting of surface generation and optimization. The surface generation tries to approximate the target through a translation of search algorithm results for object placement into a 2D mesh graph which is then linked to 3D particle spring based form-finding. The optimization consists of evaluation of structural, fabrication, and design criteria, with finally user selection. Robotic fabrication included object recognition, metal sheet folding and consideration of different metal spring back behavior. These methods were tested on a single curved arch surface and applied to a double curved cantilever canopy as a final demonstrator. The algorithm results showed a generation of different corrugated shell topologies based on iterated object placement. As a demonstrator, a part of the selected canopy was robotically fabricated from local industrial leftovers. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner’s activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation.

  abstract = {Background: There has been a dearth of research on intersectional identities in STEM, including the fields of computing and engineering. In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly lowincome, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semistructured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls' self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation.  © Teachers College 2022.}},

Our hypothesis is that the PFC detects the hierarchical structure in temporal sequences in the shape of ordinal patterns and uses them to index information hierarchically in different parts of the brain. Henceforth, we propose that this mechanism for detecting ordinal patterns participates also in the hierarchical organization of the brain during development; i.e., the bootstrapping of the connectome. By doing so, it gives the tools to the language-ready brain for manipulating abstract knowledge and for planning temporally ordered information; i.e., the emergence of causality and symbolic thinking.

Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students (M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

  abstract = {This article illustrates that the task design and problem selection are of characteristic influence to evoke sense-reason-act programming (SRA) among primary school pupils when programming robots. Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment. The influence of SRA-programming as demonstrated identifies characteristics of CT.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

This paper explores the effect that different experience and diversity of expertise has on the quality of a team's cyber security decision-making and whether teams with members from more varied backgrounds perform better than those with more focused, homogeneous skill sets. Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work.  © 1976-2012 IEEE.}},

We conducted a systematic review of 81 empirical studies to examine the nature, explicitness, and patterns of definitions of computational thinking. Data analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies operationalised computational thinking as a composite of programming concepts and preferred definitions from assessment-based frameworks. On the other hand, a substantial number of the studies did not establish the meaning of computational thinking when theorising their interventions nor clearly distinguish between computational thinking and programming.

Data sources included the results of four CT tests, as well as interviews with the teacher and surveys with 24 representative participants. The results showed that the four programming approaches can effectively improve students’ CT skills and can be retained after two months. Among them, the form of implementing unplugged activities before plugged-in can most effectively improve CT skills, and can better weaken the impact of previous programming experience. Finally, the qualitative analysis results provided insights into the process of programming and CT education.

We focus on the effect of repetition by comparing student behaviors between no intervention, 1-shot, and repeated intervention groups for two different errors that are known to be challenging in the online lessons of Unity-CT environment. Our findings showed that the agent was perceived very positively by the students and the repeated intervention showed promising results in terms of helping students make less errors and more correct behaviors, albeit only for one of the two target errors. Based on these results, we provide insights on how to improve the delivery of the agent's interventions in free-form GD environments.  © 2022 ACM.}},

  journal = {IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing}},
  abstract = {We study a distributed machine learning problem carried out by an edge server and multiple agents in a wireless network. The objective is to minimize a global function that is a sum of the agents' local loss functions. And the optimization is conducted by analog over-the-air model training. Specifically, each agent modulates its local gradient onto a set of waveforms and transmits to the edge server simultaneously. From the received analog signal the edge server extracts a noisy aggregated gradient which is distorted by the channel fading and interference, and uses it to update the global model and feedbacks to all the agents for another round of local computing. Since the electromagnetic interference generally exhibits a heavy-tailed intrinsic, we use the alpha-stable distribution to model its statistic. In consequence, the global gradient has an infinite variance that hinders the use of conventional techniques for convergence analysis that rely on second-order moments' existence. To circumvent this challenge, we take a new route to establish the analysis of convergence rate, as well as generalization error, of the algorithm. We also show that the training algorithm can be run in tandem with the momentum scheme to accelerate the convergence. Our analyses reveal a two-sided effect of the interference on the overall training procedure. On the negative side, heavy tail noise slows down the convergence rate of the model training: the heavier the tail in the distribution of interference, the slower the algorithm converges. On the positive side, heavy tail noise has the potential to increase the generalization power of the trained model: the heavier the tail, the better the model generalizes. This perhaps counterintuitive conclusion implies that the prevailing thinking on interference - that it is only detrimental to the edge learning system - is outdated and we shall seek new techniques that exploit, rather than simply mitigate, the interference for better machine learning in wireless networks.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.}},

Teachers' intuitive perspectives about optimal learning processes – "folk psychology" – impact their perspectives about teaching "folk pedagogy" and play a significant role in integrating educational technologies, such as visual programming, within the formal curriculum. This study was conducted based on the mixed method research paradigm. First, a folk pedagogy questionnaire was distributed to 89 teachers who integrate differing technologies in their classroom in order to identify the teachers' pedagogical perspectives: constructivist versus instructivist. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 teachers who teach Scratch in order to gain a deeper understanding of their instructivist/constructivist perspectives and actual pedagogical practices and strategies. Finally, we analyzed 96 students' programming artifacts to explore differences, if any, in students' outcomes related to the pedagogical perspectives of their teachers. Findings revealed that pedagogical perspectives are reflected in teaching strategies and assessment practices employed in a visual programming environment. It is promising that teaching visual programming promoted constructivist pedagogy even among instructivist teachers and was consequently reflected in student perspectives and expressed in their programming artifacts. We discuss theoretical and educational implications of these findings. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant interest among many educators around the globe. Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students’ CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students’ understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

SucreCore provides a new, more compact design, encapsulates an advanced microcontroller and supports wireless connectivity with the ability to create online variables and functions. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, has a revamped interface and allows wireless communication with SucreCore. At the pedagogical level, Sucre4Stem makes it easier to implement new group dynamics and to create novel types of collaborative projects between groups of students. In this article, we also explore how these collaborative projects can be carried out by taking advantage of the different types of communications between SucreCore and the server-side platform using shared online variables and functions.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a set of cognitive skills that every child should acquire. K–12 classrooms are expected to provide students opportunities (tasks) to think computationally. We introduce a CT competency assessment for middle school students. The assessment design process started by establishing a cognitive model of CT domain mastery, in which three broad skill types were identified to represent CT competency. After multiple-choice item prototypes were written, pilot tested, and revised, 15 of them were finally selected to be administered to 564 students in two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Using a cognitive diagnostic scoring model, mastery classifications for each student were determined that can be used diagnostically by teachers as a pretest and, perhaps in the future, to compare the outcomes of CT instructional programs. The results inform an initial understanding of typical learning progressions in CT at the middle school level. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

This study explores this gap in the context of a graduate-level secondary math education methods course in a university environment. To reduce the cognitive load for the teacher candidates as well as their students, we utilize the secondary mathematics curriculum to explore CS concepts infused into mathematics, avoiding at the same time an increase to the teaching hours to the extent that it is detrimental to the existing K-12 curriculum. Our study uses hybrid block-text programming-based teaching modules specifically designed to expose the similarities and the differences between mathematics and CS. We utilize the concept of variable and operations around it to explore how the teacher candidates' conceptions and misconceptions about CS make the understanding of those concepts easy or challenging, and how that affects their ability to incorporate them into their teaching.  © 2022 ACM.}},

Using a prescribed development process previously developed by Bell and Rhinehart (2016) for creating these briefs, teacher involved in the process saw their self-efficacy, professional networks and pedagogical content knowledge with respect to equity increase. The process allowed educators to reflect on their understanding of their particular problems of practice, while also collaboratively with expert researchers in the field to interpret previously published research results.

This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects' attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students' responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course's impact on them. In addition to other STEM disciplines (electrical, electronic, mechanical, and WEEE), the course substantially improves the CT.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

Working on their own research problems allows students to go through the entire research cycle, which promotes not only subject and methodological competencies but also the students' self-competencies. The handling of subject-specific and didactic challenges of this form of teaching-learning has been discussed many times in the past. New challenges for research-based learning now arise from the shift of teaching and learning to virtual space associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the adaptation of a research-based teaching-learning format to the demands of e-learning in the course Interaction Science with Artificial Intelligence. We evaluated the adapted teaching-learning format with 18 students in a master's program in STEM. The students stated an increase in professional competence in the areas of programming, data preparation and data visualization. Our results suggest that peer group and direct interaction via synchronous communication channels are important structural frameworks for research-based learning in an online learning context. From our results, we can derive initial implications for online-based RBL in the field of computational education. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi's overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This Innovative-Practice Full Paper presents the curriculum development of an introductory course in programming and data science for postdoctoral researchers (PDRs) in the biosciences. The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This research aims to analyze the Digital Social Networks (DSN) behavior, constructed from the network's relationships, interactions, and expressions of users' private states through collective subjectivity. For this purpose, an onion-ring system called COSSOL has been built in a case study for Twitter, following a hybrid approach to integrate Machine Learning classifiers and structural metrics from Computational Linguistics and Computational Sociology disciplines, respectively. The paper designs two experimentation scenarios divided into cases of collective subjectivity analysis for Colombia under different levels of communities' granularity. The first case validates the system by performing a cointegration test on the metrics of each construct for the onion rings' communities. The results show that some communities better propagate their subjective expressions against the disclosed topic when they have a higher network density and a common polarity. Moreover, the most stable communities in polarity towards a topic are those whose members are highly connected. Conversely, communities with a higher centrality index in a subset of members do not exhibit stability in collective subjectivity towards a topic disclosed in that community. The second case validates the model with a series of Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics with a polarity layer to describe the second onion ring subcommunities and their temporal variation through community recalculation. The results show no polar distributions similar to the bimodal ones representing consensus in the values of the common Thinking Acting and Feeling (TAF) forms. In addition, general negative sentiment is identified for the ten most representative nodes of the subcommunities analyzed.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In this Research-to-Practice Full Paper, we report on CS Pathways, a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed as part of a researcher-practitioner partnership among two public universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA. The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students' culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All. This paper advocates for the need for culturally-responsive computing, describes how it is integrated into teachers' instruction, and presents the CS Pathways curriculum design. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Filled pauses (or fillers) are the most common form of speech disfluencies and they can be recognized as hesitation markers ('um', 'uh' and 'er') made by speakers, usually to gain extra time while thinking their next words. Filled pauses are very frequent in spontaneous speech. Their detection is therefore rather important for two basic reasons: (a) their existence influences the performance of individual components, like Automatic Speech Recognition system (ASR), in human-machine interaction and (b) their frequency can characterize the overall speech quality of a particular speaker, as it can be strongly associated with the speaker's confidence. Despite that, only limited work has been published for the detection of filled pauses in speech, especially through audio. In this work, we propose a framework for filled pause detection using both audio and textual information. For the audio modality, we transfer knowledge from a plethora of supervised tasks, such as emotion or speaking rate, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For the text modality, we develop a temporal Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method that takes into account textual information derived from an ASR system. In addition, the proposed transfer learning approach for the audio classifier leads to better results when benchmarked on our internal dataset for which the text is not transcribed but estimated by an ASR system. In this case, a simple late fusion approach boosts the performance even further. This proves that the audio approach is suitable for real-world applications where the transcribed text is not available and has to leverage imperfect ASR results, or even the absence of textual information (to reduce computational cost).  © 2022 IEEE.}},

In essence, the cognitive system possesses a perception model, a memory model, and a hypothesis model. The perception model converts image information into perception codes. The memory model stores experiences in the past and present to provide to the perception model and the hypothesis model. The hypothesis model, which generates the next decision according to the experiences from the memory model, is the most important part of the proposed cognitive system. To validate the performance of the proposed system, we utilize Chinese calligraphy writing tasks by a virtual robot through simulation to evaluate the abilities of the cognitive system. In order to generate the coordinates of the writing brush, we made the virtual robot practice to learn Chinese calligraphy through bottom-up thinking to construct the writing patterns.

For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don't use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called 'Trashman'. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer's expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game's end. This will evaluate player's performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students' CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students' background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students' understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students' knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {The research-to-practice paper presents applications of genetic algorithms using multi-criterion optimization to designate student-teams in an academic setting. Teamwork skills are becoming a more desirable trait in industry today and hence more instructors are using teamwork in their engineering courses. ABET also requires engineering degree programs to have student outcomes that provide them with "an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives."This, however, comes with its challenges because the literature suggests that random or student-selected teams tend to lead to dysfunctional behaviors. Instructor-designated academic teams based on skills, learning personalities, and demographics are known to be more effective in promoting learning and positive interactions. Creating optimal homogeneous or heterogeneous teams based on multiple criteria (e.g., prior knowledge, skills, abilities, psychosocial, demographics) can be a complex and time-consuming task when done manually, especially when large numbers of students are involved.This study presents an expansion of previous work that used single-criterion genetic algorithm optimization of teams in a first-year classroom. The research question answered in this study is, how do teams formed using an algorithm that optimizes multiple criteria with genetic algorithms represent heterogeneity when compared to teams formed manually? Using a Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA), optimization of multiple skills is conducted to attain uniform heterogeneity in the classroom. The algorithm uses discrete integer-type representations as a basic unit of team configuration. Self-reported student competency data on three different computational skills were used. Teams were formed for approximately 1300 students enrolled in a first-year engineering design thinking course at a large Midwestern University. Four-member teams were maximized with a minimum number of teams with 3 students in each section. Average skills of the teams are calculated and the standard deviation in class is minimized for each of three skills parallelly. The algorithm also aims to maintain diversity of teams based on gender and ethnicity.Results presented include visualization of team-configurations and comparison with teams formed manually using the same criteria. The aim of the algorithm is to optimize students into teams that have skills and demographics uniformly distributed across the classroom. Future implications of this study include the potential to use flexible algorithm-based team formations that are built with standard genetic operators so that optimization criteria can be modified by the instructor. Such algorithms can reduce the time needed to manually form teams by a considerable amount and optimize the distribution of skills more uniformly. Steps to further this study will involve investigating whether teams formed using these criteria are more effective. © 2022 IEEE.}},

In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking. © 2022 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {A Python-based lab activity was developed for a remote Thermodynamics course to add computational thinking to traditional analytical problem solving. Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. Nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. Whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills. © 2022 IEEE.}},

The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student's language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners' mental models of abstract algorithms.

However., as a cross-domain competency., appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed., the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on using scales or test to measure programming proficiency and neglecting process evaluation in which CT can also be manifested. Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely 'Analysis'., 'Design'., 'Iteration'., and 'Generalization'., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators.

Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity.

In computer science education a majority of games and approaches exist, that provide engaging environments for students. On the one hand, these can be games related to learning algorithmic thinking but on the other hand, games to learn coding. Besides single-player games, there are also multiplayer games where players compete against each other or collaboratively work on programming tasks. However, many existing multiplayer games offer pre-defined levels where teachers have limited flexibility and individuality for their students. Additionally, many existing game environments use competitive over collaborative approaches. In our project, we extended an existing game by a multiplayer mode where players work together on coding tasks. The game elements support many coding-related concepts but also computational skills such as sequencing, conditionals, loops, and also advanced topics such as concurrency or dependencies using meaningful levels and tasks. However, we conducted an evaluation including 41 participants in three workshops: two in-class activities with secondary school students and an online activity with computer science students. Within these workshops, the students collaboratively worked on coding tasks within the game environment. Thereby, we observed the communication between the students while working on the tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the students' attitudes towards collaborative learning. We found out that the in-game chat is barely used while in-class activities, especially when the tasks require only low coordination between players. We also found out, that students learn from each other and are more motivated when working together. With our approach, we want to provide educators with a flexible game environment where students can collaboratively improve their coding skills while solving engaging tasks. © 2022 Immersive Learning Research Network.}},

Schizophrenia (Sz) is a brain disorder that severely affects the thinking, behavior, and feelings of people worldwide. Thus, an accurate and rapid detection method is needed for proper care and quality treatment of the patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) is proved to be an efficient biomarker in Sz detection as it records brain activities. This article aims to improve the performance of EEG-based Sz detection using a deep-learning approach in remote applications. A hybrid deep-learning model identified as schizophrenia hybrid neural network (SzHNN), which is a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), has been proposed wherein the CNN for local feature extraction and LSTM for classification is utilized. In this article, the proposed model has been compared with several deep-learning and machine-learning-based models. All the models have been evaluated on two different datasets wherein dataset 1 consists of 19 subjects and dataset 2 consists of 16 subjects. The proposed model is also implemented with the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) framework for smart healthcare and remote-based applications. Several experiments have been conducted using various parametric settings on different frequency bands and different sets of electrodes on the scalp. Based on all the experiments, it is evident that the proposed hybrid model (SzHNN) provides the highest classification accuracy of 99.9% compared to other implemented models and existing models of previous papers. The proposed model overcomes the influence of different frequency bands and shows a better accuracy of 96.10% (dataset 1) and 91.00% (dataset 2) with only five electrodes.

A number of studies using the Brainbit brain-computer were carried out as a part of various activities, including the performance of tasks with the Expert air traffic controller simulator. Findings from computational processing of electroencephalography signals revealed the degree of synchronization of brain hemispheres depending on the complexity of the tasks. We propose to use a ratio of mean values of direct and inverse correlation across short epochs as a synchronization (coordination) factor for the activities of both hemispheres. We were able to identify regularities behind the change of the coordination factor depending on the complexity of the task and the degree of involvement in its performance. Three levels of task complexity (high, medium and low) were identified. The coordination factor will vary depending on the complexity level of a particular task. We were able to determine that a high involvement in the performance of a medium-complexity task is accompanied by a high level of coordination. This lets us determine the attained development level of professional and mental capabilities of an aeronavigation system operator and to develop an individual training path.  © 2022 IEEE.}},

Results from early testing with university students enrolled in the education of Media Studies show that the game is usable, levels can be solved at various degrees of complexity (e.g. with and without using loops), and that the students were able to make sense of our twin-worlds levels and formulate general algorithms for both worlds.

Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming.

Only one of them is specific to functional (Riemannian) theory and can possibly be replaced to represent scale degree theory.

And if the structure of pictograms can be described as a procedural program, then it is based on algorithmic thinking. Pictoch especially focuses on human pictogram. This effect of the human pictogram can be familiar with 'syntonic learning.' advocated by Papert.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been described as a set of valuable skills for tackling complex problems. To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem. © 2022 IEEE.}},

Much recent work in sociology proposes ‘methods mashups’ of ethnography and digital data/computational tools in different and diverse ways. However, typically, these have taken the form of applying (with or without tweaks) the principles of ethnography to new domains and data types, as if ethnography itself is stable and immutable; that it has a universal set of methodological principles that unify ethnographic practice. Returning to anthropology (whence, arguably, ethnography originally came) is, therefore, a useful way to extend our methodological thinking to (re)consider what ethnography is and how it operates, and from there think more clearly about how it may be effectively combined with digital data/computational tools in an emerging ‘Computational Anthropology’. © The Author(s) 2022.}},

We propose a simple and natural formalization of sequential decomposition, in which a task is decomposed into two sequential sub-tasks, with the first sub-task to be executed before the second sub-task is executed. These tasks are specified by means of input/output relations. We define and study decomposition problems, which is to decide whether a given specification can be sequentially decomposed. Our main result is that decomposition itself is a difficult computational problem. More specifically, we study decomposition problems in three settings: where the input task is specified explicitly, by means of Boolean circuits, and by means of automatic relations. We show that in the first setting decomposition is NP-complete, in the second setting it is NEXPTIME-complete, and in the third setting there is evidence to suggest that it is undecidable. Our results indicate that the intuitive idea of decomposition as a systemdesign approach requires further investigation. In particular, we show that adding a human to the loop by asking for a decomposition hint lowers the complexity of decomposition problems considerably. © D. Fried, A. Legay, J. Ouaknine, and M.Y.

Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners' projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity.

A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of educational robots in terms of standardized mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD) of test scores as outcome measures. The overall effect size was medium (SMD = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23–0.69). Subgroup analysis found that some groups to have better effectiveness. Specifically, the effect of STEM attitudes (SMD = 0.01) was smaller than computational thinking (SMD = 0.48). Educational robots had more significant effect on boys (MD = 0.39) than girls (MD = 0.27). The effect in primary school (SMD = 0.27) was higher than in middle school (SMD = 0.04), and the effect was great on short-term instruction with educational robots (SMD = 0.35). Based on these results, the study makes some recommendations for educators about strengthening the influence of educational robots on STEM attitudes, improving the persistence of their learning effects, and further exploring their application models. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

At the roots of computational-thinking abilities stands the knowledge of computer programming, i.e. coding. With the goal of fostering computational thinking in young students, we address the challenging and open problem of using methods, tools and techniques to support teaching and learning of computer-programming skills in school curricula of the secondary grade and university courses. This problem is made complex by several factors. In fact, coding requires abstraction capabilities and complex cognitive skills such as procedural and conditional reasoning, planning, and analogical reasoning.

  abstract = {Background: Unplugged programming is proved to be an effective means to foster the learner-centered programming learning. In addition to the final tests, learners’ programming knowledge, skills, and capacities are primarily demonstrated throughout the programming process, particularly in the situation when they encounter challenges and problems. However, few studies examine how learners engage in the programming processes and to what extent unplugged programming fosters learning. This research used a quasi-experimental design to investigate two instructional modes in China’s secondary education, namely, the instructor-directed lecturing and the learner-centered unplugged programming. Based on an analytical framework, this research used mixed methods to compare learners’ knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under these two instructional modes. Results: The research results revealed discrepancies between two instructional modes. First, learners in the unplugged programming class achieved significantly higher scores on the programming knowledge assessment, compared to learners in the traditional lecturing class. Second, compared to the traditional lecturing class, learners in the unplugged programming class had higher test scores of the computational thinking skills, particularly on the cooperativity dimension. Next, discrepancies of in-class behaviors showed that learners in the unplugged programming class had frequent behaviors of listening to the instructor’s instructions and discussing with peers, while learners in the instructor-directed class had frequent behaviors of listening to instructor, taking notes, and irrelevant activities. Learners’ self-reported attitudes in the unplugged programming indicated a higher level of confidence than learners in the traditional lecturing class. Overall, this research revealed that the learner-centered unplugged programming had potential to improve learners’ programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes compared to the traditional instructor-directed lecturing of programming. Conclusions: As a feasible and easy-to-use instructional activity in computer science education, unplugged programming is encouraged to be integrated in formal education to increase learners’ programming interests, motivations, and qualities. This quasi-experimental research compared learners’ programming knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes under two instructional modes. The results revealed critical discrepancies between two instructional modes on learners’ knowledge gains, in-class behaviors, and changes of attitudes towards programming.

This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books’ target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as “foundational,” “on-target,” or “advanced.” We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived 'computation' as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around 'data', 'model' and 'simulations' critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices.

Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.

The results show that learning through VPE or physical robots can help students improve their computational thinking ability and that students learn better via physical robots. In addition, among the four dimensions of computational thinking ability, most students are weak in algorithm design. In terms of gender, no differences exist in computational thinking ability.

A multimedia adventure game was presented in which they had to solve phonological awareness challenges through the manipulation of tangible technology to achieve the final goal. The observation was recorded in the designed evaluation model, allowing the analysis of pre-and post-intervention data after the triangulation of data for subsequent qualitative analysis.

We present a six-lesson intervention designed by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and teachers with a background in computer science and mathematics education that aims to foster pre-university students' AT and generalization skills in calculus lessons. We evaluated the intervention in a 15 students classroom in the Netherlands through the analysis of students' workbooks, files, interviews, and the teacher's logbook. The findings suggest that the intervention was favorably seen by both the teacher and the students, and that their learning and teaching experience was highly satisfactory. The most common challenges for successfully completing the designed material included issues related to getting familiar with GeoGebra, syntax, and effectively using conditional statements. Finally, we report on the learning and teaching experience and discuss strategies to address AT and generalization aspects for teachers who wish to address such CT aspects in mathematics lessons.  © 2021 Owner/Author.}},

However, today's games perpetuate an arguably obsolete relationship between programmable agents and human operators. Borrowing from the field of human-robotics interaction, we argue that collaborative robots, or cobots, are a better model for thinking about computational agents, working directly with humans rather than in place of or at arm's length from them. In this paper, we describe an initial design inquiry into the design of "cobot games", programmable agent scenarios in which players program an in-game ally to assist them in accomplishing gameplay objectives. We detail three questions that emerged out of this exploration, our present thinking on them, and plans for deepening inquiry into cobot game design moving forward. © 2021 Owner/Author.}},

  abstract = {Recently educational robotics has expanded into curriculum beyond traditional STEM fields, and which can also be used to foster computational thinking (CT) skills. Prior research has shown numerous interdisciplinary benefits related to CT, however, these influential factors have often been investigated with relatively few variables. This study investigated factors that may lead to 4th and 5th grade elementary school students’ development of computational thinking skills in collaborative robotics activities by hypothesizing a model which proposed that a problem solving inventory, intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment were the main predictors of computational thinking skills. The model was then tested by surveying students with several psychometric inventories where a revised model was then constructed. The study found significant relationships between perceived competence and enjoyment, and learning motivation, and intrinsic motivation. Another important finding was that problem solving was a significant predictor of computational thinking skills. Results were interpreted with reference to implications for possible means of improving learning outcomes when using collaborative robotics in an educational setting. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

  abstract = {Difficulties in teaching and learning introductory programming have been studied over the years. The students' difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {CT has been the central rallying point for K-12 computing education at least since the early 2010s. Many teachers, school administrators, and policymakers have joined the movement. A consensus has emerged over the conceptual landscape of CT. Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) has triggered some major changes in many sectors of computing. Children's lives today are full of ML-driven services - take TikTok's spot-on recommendations, social media's automatic tagging of their friends in photos, and targeted personalized advertisement, just to mention a few. Children cannot learn to think about and design ML technology from learning classical programming. ML is poised to upend the CT consensus. Look at some of the changes ML has already triggered in computing. It has enabled greatly improved speech and image recognition, powerful recommendations on streaming services, autonomous navigation of cars, super-human performance in board and computer games, and even alternative-reality "deepfake"videos. Most advances in topics above are due to hardware evolution to non-traditional, special purpose architectures, new algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or generative adversarial networks (GAN), and new objectives and measures of success. We will show that several key CT concepts, including debugging, problem-solving workflow, correctness, and notional machines, are insufficient for ML and need to be extended. Moreover, ML introduces new concepts including neural networks, curating and training data, and reinforcement learning that are not part of CT at all. All these changes challenge the traditional views related to teaching CT in K-12. ML is not the only emerging technology appearing in the computing landscape. Quantum computing and biological computing are not far behind. We need to start rethinking how CT must evolve to anticipate and meet these challenges.  © 2021 ACM.}},

Based on this preliminary literature study, semi-structured interviews with eight CT scholars are conducted, in order to evaluate these aspects and to identify qualitatively different perspectives on CT, which integrate the mentioned aspects in different ways. From the interviews, three different perspectives emerged, focusing on: Reasoning, Simplification, and Automation. Furthermore, the goal of having computationally educated citizens is extrapolated from the interviews, indicating an additional perspective (+1) titled Empowerment, which appears as embedded within all the previous three perspectives.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) can be considered a 21st century core skill and, accordingly, it should be taught to students at an early age. Nevertheless, the implementation of CT in school curricula is still in an experimental stage, given that different performance metrics remain unclear, including the appropriate age for learning each skill, the significant and achievable computational concepts for each school year, teaching strategies, learning effectiveness, and strategies for assessing development. Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode. The combination of different assessment methodologies - including CT pre- and posttests, data-driven analytics, direct observation, and questionnaires - provides assessment for each of the framework computational dimensions.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

A recent trend is to introduce basic programming concepts already very early on at primary school level.

In this paper, we describe our experience of a project aiming at supporting local primary schools in introducing children to programming concepts using Ozobot robots. These robots have two distinct advantages: First, they can be programmed with and without computers, thus helping the transition from unplugged programming to programming with a computer. Second, they are small and easy to transport, even when used together with tablet computers.

First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software.

Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Increasingly in K–12 schools, students are gaining access to computational thinking (CT) and computer science (CS). This access, however, is not always extended to students with disabilities.

In this study, researchers explore exposing special education preservice teachers to the ideas of CT/CS in the context of a mathematics methods course for students with disabilities or those at risk of disability. Through analyzing lesson plans and reflections from 31 preservice special education teachers, the researchers learned that overall emerging promise exists with regard to the limited exposure of preservice special education teachers to CT/CS in mathematics. Specifically, preservice teachers demonstrated the ability to include CT/CS in math lesson plans and showed understanding of how CT/CS might enhance instruction with students with disabilities via reflections on these lessons. The researchers, however, also found a need for increased experiences and opportunities for preservice special education teachers with CT/CS to more positively impact access for students with disabilities. © 2021 Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.}},

  abstract = {With the global movement to incorporate computer science instruction into elementary education, learners are being introduced to computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) ideas at increasingly younger ages. At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use->Modify->Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores. These results indicate TIPP&SEE's potential in creating more equitable computing instruction. We hope that results from this initial exploration can help encourage further study into the role of cognitive abilities in CS/CT education for young learners. © 2021 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Dialog with a social pedagogical robot or agent is a powerful way for kids to learn [1, 5] but may limit the formation of an agentic relationship with the technology [9]. One main purpose of conversational agents is to allow the user to have a natural interaction that reduces the need to learn artificial conventions [6], but dialog systems fall short with respect to failure recovery, vocabulary diversity, remembering conversational history, and other measures [2, 3]. Further, Hill et. al. [4] found that people adapt their model of communication to match a chatbot's in the same way they do with a child or non-native speaker. Thus, users conversing with a pedagogical agent are implicitly trained to shape their behavior to suit the technology rather than shaping the technology. For young learners, particularly among populations that have been historically excluded from technology fields, this limits agency and reinforces marginalizing power structures [9]. This project combines a conversational agent with ideas of agentic engagement to help middle-school-aged children learn computational thinking. Agentic engagement is defined as students' constructive contribution into the flow of instruction and includes behaviors such as expressing interests, preferences, and opinions. It has been positively correlated to learning performance and motivation [7, 8]. Combined with a culturally responsive curriculum (CRC), agentic engagement may help to foster an agentic relationship with technology. Our system encourages learners to engage agentically by using programming constructs to change the agent's vocabulary, recognizing the intent behind a user utterance (an invocation), and defining the action the agent will take to respond to an invocation. Students use computational thinking concepts such as pattern recognition, abstraction, and decomposition to convert ideas into commands for the dialog system and to understand which of their ideas can't be programmed with the technology as presented. They learn both to personalize the system today and to see the agent as a technosocial construct that they can shape in the future. Programming can be accomplished either using Google's Blockly visual programming tool (https://developers.google.com/blockly) or through conversation with the agent itself. The agent is embodied as a robot character, so agent actions can be verbal, physical, or both. Through social dialog with the agent, learners reflect on how computational thinking is relevant to themselves and their communities as part of a CRC, building on the work of Stewart et. al. [10]. For example, learners may be asked to reflect on the relationship between greeting behaviors and identity. After designing a greeting interaction, learners program the dialog system to achieve the greeting. Then learners may be asked to imagine how they might hypothetically enhance the dialog system to make it even more capable of implementing their preferences. In parallel to the development of the dialog system and curriculum, we will also adapt Reeve's agentic engagement instrument [7] for CRC. Our contributions will include this instrument, insights into the relationship between agentic engagement and an agentic relationship with technology, and insights into how a programmable dialog system impacts agentic engagement and learning computational thinking. © 2021 Owner/Author.}},

This study looks to bridge this gap by examining the association between CT and two types of creativity, i.e., Creative Thinking and Computational Creativity. The research was conducted among 124 middle school students from Spain, who were divided into control and experimental groups; the intervention included an explicit encouragement to be as creative as possible (i.e., to submit multiple correct solutions) in a given learning task. Data were analyzed from a standardized creativity test (Torrance's TTCT) and cross-referenced with log files that documented the students' activities in the Kodetu game-based learning environment. Our research findings indicate some interesting associations between CT and Creativity. First, we found that creativity contributes to CT. Second, we found that CT is transferable across different domains. Finally, we found that Computational Creativity can develop and improve over time. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

We implemented this model in a CT-integrated lesson in two sections of a high-school Spanish course. Students worked in small groups and coded three small and one comprehensive digital Spanish-culture stories in Scratch. Results showed that students taking the CT-integrated lesson had the same degree of improvement in their Spanish culture knowledge as their peers who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. Besides, students taking the CT-integrated lesson had a significant improvement in their CT knowledge. At the same time, their CT self-efficacy outperformed those who did not take the CT-integrated lesson.

In this study, a new integrated mathematical approach is proposed to address designing a multi-stage, multi-product and multi-period open loop reverse supply chain network which maximizes the profit and utilizes reverse logistics to benefit the environment in the most efficient way. The proposed approach presents a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) that uses water treatment facility along with the common components of open loop reverse supply chain (OLSC).

Second, we use a content analysis to establish how common the practice is on Scratch. Third, we conduct a qualitative analysis of user activity over time and identify three factors that serve as social antecedents of participatory debugging: (1) sustained community, (2) identifiable problems, and (3) what we call “topic porousness” to describe conversations that are able to span multiple topics.

Moreover, the thinking of developing applications has changed from monolithic once to microservices. Hence, we developed a highly scalable and available multi-objective neural architecture search and adopted to the modern thinking of developing application by subdividing an already existing, monolithic neural architecture search - based on a genetic algorithm - into microservices. Furthermore, we adopted the initial population creation by 1, 000 mutations of each individual, extended the approach by inception layers, implemented it as island model to facilitate scalability and achieved on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset 99.75%, 94.35% and 89.90% test accuracy respectively. Besides, our model is strongly focused on high availability empowered by the deployment in our bare-metal Kubernetes cluster.

An explorative factor analysis using the principal axis method with the oblimin rotation was used to validate the scale. Finally, 19 items were extracted successfully under the designed five dimensions, with a total explained variance of 64.03% and an overall reliability of 0.91. Results of the demographic comparisons showed that boys had a greater disposition than girls in decomposition thinking when solving problems using computer programming.

The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold. © 2021 IEEE.}},

Just as in math and language, a strong CT foundation needs to be established in early education in order for students to develop an instinctive CT perspective of the world. The urgent demand for CT instruction in elementary school quickly draws attention to the shortage of elementary school-level teachers qualified and interested in CT. Additionally, with a commitment to equity in the United States education system and knowledge of the high percentage of English language learning (ELL) students in schools, the obligation to create curricula that will provide access to CT knowledge, skills, and practices for elementary-level ELL students is loudly apparent. In response to these two needs, our team has adapted existing Scratch-based CT curriculum to support classroom teachers with minimal CT experience and to be more accessible to English language learners. The purpose of this paper is to share the framework that guided the curriculum adaptations, to describe the specific changes that were made, and to discuss discoveries made during the process.

Designing a learning activity which integrates CT into English language learning has been considered in only a few academic studies. This study aimed to explore whether integrating CT into English language learning can be useful for improving learners’ motivation and performance. The method of “present, practice, and produce” was applied as a method of presenting computational thinking in the English language learning classroom. Fifty-two elementary school students (52) participated in the experimental study. Following an experimental design, data were collected and analyzed from a combination of knowledge test scores, storytelling, motivation, and anxiety surveys.

  abstract = {Investigating the current college computer-common class teaching in South China University of Technology (SCUT), it's indicated that although the online and offline blended teaching was practiced, there's still a lack of classroom interaction and hierarchical teaching. So high-quality teaching needs a reform of teaching mode urgently. In order to improve the teaching quality of computer-common class, an online and offline blended teaching mode with the integration of three supports, three concepts and three stages is proposed, analyzing the characteristics of learners and constructing online courses. The three concepts are "student-centered", "teaching practice as the key point"and "focusing on students' learning process "respectively. With the supports of teaching, management and evaluation, a three-stage teaching process is designed, which consists of pre-class preparation, the teaching activities based on flipped classroom and the evaluation. This study took the course: "Multimedia Technology and Application (MTA)", as an example to carry out this blended teaching mode in SCUT from 2017 to 2019. The results implied that this model had promoted students' participation and interest in learning, improved the achievement of course objectives and teaching quality, and boost students' computational thinking ability and information literacy.  © 2021 ACM.}},

  abstract = {This paper explores a survey instrument on Computational Thinking (CT) and attitudes towards Computing for educational purposes. Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2, 290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context. © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Set in English Language Arts, this article takes up recent trends in literacy toward investigating ontological notions of digital texts. Two teacher educators recently implemented a series of readings and activities in their methods courses designed to help preservice teachers sophisticate their conceptions of texts beyond autonomous, neutral collections of information by considering digital age ideas such as software theory, textual ideology, and the algorithmic bias of the Internet. The authors review recent scholarship surrounding the integration of computational thinking and the humanities before illustrating a theoretical framework that combines software-driven interpretation and critical media literacy. Descriptions and applications of course texts and exercises precede a discussion on typological methodology. Through the analysis of semester-long writing reflections and course interactions, a typology of preservice teachers is then presented, illustrating three archetypes: Strategists, Hawkeyes, and Improvers. These archetypes are taken up to analyze the ways in which a range of teacher candidates considered ontological notions of digital texts to analyze instructional techniques, to sharpen their critical lenses, or to gain greater understanding of ELA as a discipline (or some combination of all three). This work demonstrates that as teacher educators and teacher candidates increasingly consider software-powered literacies, interrogations of who we are, who we are becoming, and what it all means requires attention to, and explicit practice with, the dark side of digital texts. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

  abstract = {Debugging code is a central skill in learning to program. Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if 'the internet' stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience. © 2021 IEEE.}},

The participants were 360 students studying in various departments at different universities in Turkey for computer programming. The scale consists of 33 items under conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation subscale. While there was no significant difference between the students’ conceptual knowledge and algorithmic thinking skills, the evaluation skills of male students differed significantly compared to females. Programming experience has a significant effect on conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation. The algorithmic thinking skills of the students who have low, middle, and high-level programming experience differed significantly. In terms of the development of conceptual knowledge and evaluation skills, it was observed that students should have at least one year of programming experience, but this experience will not make a significant difference if it is four years or more. It is thought that this scale, which is structured for different applications (e.g., web, game, robot) and learning environments (e.g., text, block) within the framework of its programming capabilities (conceptual, semantic, strategic knowledge), will contribute significantly to the evaluation of computational thinking as programming oriented. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

Our findings show that learning with the adaptive educational computer game significantly improved students’ computational thinking related to both conceptual knowledge and skills.

While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops. © 2021 IEEE.}},

The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children. © 2021 IEEE.}},

This case study aimed to understand how teachers make connections between CT and subjects targeted for integration. Epistemological framing contributed new insights on why teachers connected CT in different ways to different subjects: Frame shifting focused teachers' attention on goals and activities specific to each subject. As teachers attended to a subject's particularities, they drew upon different epistemic resources to construct their descriptions of CT. Our participants (n=6) were teachers who taught both 7th-12th grade computing and mathematics as separate subjects. Qualitative coding of interview transcripts revealed that teachers' ideas about CT in computing were strongly influenced by computer programming while their ideas about CT in mathematics corresponded with familiar ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Instead of accepting fragmented notions of CT as the price of integration into individual subjects, we propose limiting the scope when defining CT. We explain how this non-intuitive strategy can preserve the coherence of CT and how it might be used in CT professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers. © 2021 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Block-based programming languages effectively address syntactic difficulties allowing users to more easily create code. Syntactic code support is no doubt a crucial step in enabling the next generation of programmers. However, in what other ways do these tools support the computational thinking (CT) process? For example, how is CT supported in both the semantic and pragmatic levels? Most users do not just want to write code?they want to create interesting artifacts such as video games, simulations, stories and robots. No doubt that users must code to build these artifacts, but just as important, though often overlooked, is that users must also have an understanding of tool affordances to effectively build these artifacts. The position presented in this paper is that the comprehension of affordances is essential to each stage of the computational thinking process. To that end, we introduce the Hourglass Challenge as a way for students to experience affordances through a programming challenge based on mis-aligned tools and problems. The results from a study, with 54 preservice elementary school teachers, indicate that the affordances of tools can have profound consequences on computational thinking. For instance, the affordances various tools provide can be the difference between creating a simulation versus an animation. But just as hammers are not intrinsically better tools than screwdrivers, the contribution of this position paper is not to compare tools, but to promote efforts that enable learners to develop a better understanding of computational thinking tool affordances as essential mediators between problems and tools. © 2021 ACM.}},

In this investigation we explore how a workshop on AI and the creation of programming projects with LearningML impacts the knowledge on AI of students between 10 and 16 years. 135 participants completed all phases of the learning experience, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic had to be performed online.

Although analyzing computational fluid dynamics simulations is exciting enough, the theory is equation intensive, sometimes very abstract and also difficult to visualize for the novice. A creative thinking based approach termed synectics, which involves analogies, was therefore applied in classroom teaching to increase student comfort with the equations. For this purpose six analogies encompassing basic computational fluid dynamics concepts were developed along with pictorial representations, and are presented in this work. These analogies were integrated into classroom teaching via synectics procedures. Student feedback was positive and reflected higher engagement with the course compared to when the metaphoric activity was not implemented.

  abstract = {As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students' ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools. © 2021 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is a method of analysis and problem solving that enables the development of life skills and positively influences the social and competitive conditions of people. This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners' skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises. This paper presents the joint research between the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC) and the PRONIE MEP-FOD program of the Omar Dengo Foundation. Its objective is to automatically analyze the source code created by the students, evaluate the Computational Thinking skills they developed and compare the results with the learning objectives established in the study plans. © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This article focuses on the educational aspects of mentoring chemistry postgraduate students, analysing the challenges encountered by students in the transition from undergraduate to postgraduate learning, and throughout the postgraduate projects up to completion of PhD level, and discussing the design of suitable addressing options by the mentor. The mentoring activity is thus viewed within a typical chemistry education paradigm. Some challenges basically continue those encountered at undergraduate level and others are specific to the postgraduate one, thus requiring new approaches. The information presented in the article is mostly based on the author’s long experience at the University of Venda (South Africa). The approach utilised in the study is a suitable adaptation of action research. The analysis aims at being comprehensive, considering the major features influencing students’ performance, and the strategies that can be adopted to counteract negative impacts and to foster the development of scientific modes of thinking and of research independence. It outlines how known major difficulties, such as diffuse poor language mastery (aggravated by second language instruction), complicate both the undergraduate-postgraduate transition—by affecting the speed and extent to which students learn new approaches—and the further stages, including thesis writing. Writing-related difficulties are given particular attention because they have great impact even for students who have acquired good abilities with the design and practical components of research projects, and because the acquisition of adequate skills in scientific writing is an inherent objective of postgraduate training. Most of the reported observations refer to postgraduate studies in computational chemistry; this enables a broad perspective, by including the common challenges of obtaining, organising and analysing data, as well as the challenges related to learning a new area of chemistry, not encountered in undergraduate studies, and those related to specific demands such as adequate mathematics knowledge, visualization abilities and the ability to abstract thinking. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.}},

For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2.

  abstract = {From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all.

  abstract = {This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for K-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme 'Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development'. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This research-track work-in-progress paper contributes to engineering education by documenting progress in developing a new standard Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic to measure engineering student success in five factors of computational thinking. Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession. Currently, the diagnostic identifies general computational thinking skill  © 2021 IEEE.}},

Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city.

Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019-2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique 'synchronized' online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond 'a set of order instructions', even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps.

As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking.

  abstract = {The ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar plays an important role in surveillance, precision tracking, and classification of ground moving targets. The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed.

  abstract = {Computational thinking is a type of analytical thinking that is developed intentionally, that is, under a 'learned' approach, and the best way to learn it is through computer programming. In this paper, the experience of using block-based programming environments such as Scratch, Lightbot and the PSelnt pseudo-code tool for the understanding of computational concepts and development of computational thinking skills is reported. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results. It is concluded that block-based programming environments favor the construction of knowledge and foster the development of creativity and algorithmic thinking.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

CT has become a fundamental approach to building problem-solving skills, which requires a thought process. The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field. Besides, the findings also create an opportunity for positioning CT in HEI's educational curriculum regarding how CT should be taught in that context.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents the development and implementation of an innovative online adaptive gamification platform for learning Computational Thinking (CT). CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period.

The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game.

The assessment of target users 10-15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers.

To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging.

A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call 'mining cultural capital'. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers. © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (CS), there is a growing push for inclusion of CS concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (CT), in required subjects like science. Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms. © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term 'Computational Thinking' usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

As a proposal, a suggestion of gamified activity in the style of a game known as 'escape room' was presented, using the Google Forms tool. We note that insecurity with technological tools or lack of knowledge about some features of these same tools is still a factor that causes many concerns among teachers.

At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students. © 2021 IEEE.}},

This study is part of a larger National Science Foundation funded STEM+C (computing) study that integrates CT in informal STEM learning. The informal STEM+CT curriculum resulted from the large study was guided by project-based learning (PBL) to help 4th to 6th grade students practice CT in the context of problem solving. Twenty-four teachers have worked with small groups of students in an afterschool community center program over an 8-weeks period. The larger STEM+C study also encouraged teachers in adapting the informal STEM+CT curriculum in their own classrooms, which eight of the 24 teachers have done so. This study investigates the participating teacher's perspective on implementing CT into elementary classrooms after they had facilitated the STEM+CT curriculum in community centers' after-school programs via interviewing 12 of the 24 teachers. The current study focuses on the challenges and issues regarding implementing CT in elementary classrooms. The results show that teachers collectively place the lack of time and the lack of professional development as the major obstacles in integrating CT into elementary classrooms.  © 2021 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Educational digital storytelling is widely recognised as a powerful approach in developing literary skills, experiencing problem-solving and computational thinking, information and knowledge visualisation, building creativity and divergent thinking supported by technological solutions. However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else's story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

School outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions.

In 2020 the tool has been used during the 'CodyTrip' event, a two-day visit to the town of Urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. Results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics.

  abstract = {The paper presents the details of a four-year project to test the effectiveness of teaching spreadsheeting with spreadsheet programming, instead of the traditional, widely accepted surface approach methods. The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences. © 2013 IEEE.}},

Conflicting CT conceptualizations and little understanding of evidence-based strategies for CTCI could result in significant barriers to increasing students’ access to CT. To address these concerns, we analyzed 80 studies on CT education, focusing on both the CT conceptualizations guiding current CT education research and evidence-based strategies for CTCI. Our review highlights the code-centric nature of CT education and reveals significant gaps in our understanding of CTCI and CT professional development for teachers.

Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide. © The Author(s) 2021.}},

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards. © 2013 IEEE.}},

Educational games as a means of promoting computational thinking skills have gained popularity in recent years. Offering efficient educational games that promote computational thinking competencies requires personalized learning paths through adaptive difficulty. The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance. Using regression analysis, we defined a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges that considers the weights of these factors and provides a first step towards the design of adaptive learning paths for computational thinking-related educational games.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {There have been several explanations advanced to account for the unsteady levels of political participation among Blacks in recent years, but rather unfortunately, little research has been conducted into the role local issues may play. National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have turned-off potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, all politics are local, and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN?

Such systems are often deployed on a long-term basis and deserve strong protection due to the sensitive nature and persistence property of the data they contain. To achieve efficient template protection, we combine post-quantum secure two-party computation with secret sharing and apply the first practically implemented post-quantum secure two-party computation protocol for the purpose of biometric template protection. The proposed system ensures permanent protection of the biometric data as templates are stored and compared in the encrypted domain. For the verification, we present two options which can be achieved as real-time transactions: A well-established classical two-party computation scheme or a recent post-quantum upgrade of that scheme. Both methods maintain full biometric performance. For the database of reference templates, which is a target for attacks in a biometric system, post-quantum security is maintained throughout both verification options. Regarding the computational efficiency of our proposed system, we offer real-time computational transaction times, making our solution relevant for practical applications. © 2020 IEEE.}},

The proposed FACT pedagogy has been implemented using the concept of X-ray machine in biomedical instrumentation course and biomolecules, in biochemistry course. Using fishbone approach, various components of X-ray machine in biomedical course and the components of biomolecules in biochemistry course are visually explained as ribs and riblets of a fishbone diagram, without coining the keywords X-ray and biomolecules in an engineering institution and science institution respectively. Finally, the targeted concept is arrived and explained. Similarly, the same concepts of X-ray and biomolecules are coined among students and they are asked to divide or decompose the concepts into sub-concepts separately. To implement and evaluate the proposed pedagogy, an engineering institution and a science institution have been selected and evaluation results have been published in this article. In this pedagogical approach, the same complex concept is taught as a backward thinking by the teacher using fishbone pedagogy and forward thinking by the students using computational thinking pedagogy. This combined approach helps students to understand any complex concept in science courses. Also, it helps the teachers to easily convey and embed the same among the student community while teaching science courses. © 2020 The Kerala State Higher Education Council.}},

The research was conducted among 174 middle school students from Spain. Data collected using a standardized creativity test (Torrance's TTCT) were triangulated with data drawn from students' log files that documented their activity in a game-based learning environment for CT (Kodetu). We found some interesting associations between CT and the two constructs of creativity. These associations shed light on positive associations between each of the two creativity constructs and CT acquisition, as well as between the two creativity constructs themselves. Additionally, we highlight differences between boys and girls, as girls were found to be more creative on both creativity measures.

  abstract = {The project Death and Burial Data: Ireland 1864-1922 (DBDIrl) examines the relationship between historical death registration data and burial data to explore the history of power in Ireland from 1864 to 1922. Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program.

Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with ‘code smells’ such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game’s efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques.

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) and related concepts, as programming and algorithmic thinking, have been recently advocated as abilities that are as fundamental as numeracy and literacy, and many countries all over the world are introducing programming activities in education. In Italy, even if the introduction of CT and programming in schools is on the pipeline of policy makers, they have not yet been included in the curriculum guidelines. Consequently, there is a strong case for analyzing how programming can be integrated at early stages into the Italian compulsory education. Starting from the constructivist tradition, a study spanning over several school years has been organized aiming at defining and testing a programming learning path for primary schools. The learning path takes into account children's interests, stimulating their passions and creativity. Students are engaged on projects that are meaningful for them, while teachers take advantage of the situations that spontaneously arise to guide students' attention on specific computational concepts. The learning path is being iteratively refined through a field experiment involving a primary school over a four year period. The study aims to the following questions: • Under which conditions can age-appropriate programming activities, allowing for individual differences in learning styles and approaches, work in primary school? • Which indications can the work performed provide to the sustainability of the programming activities when the researchers' support will come to an end? • Which elements of the study can provide suggestions for a wider introduction of programming in primary schools? Since the study is currently in its third year, this paper addresses the first two research question, while only some initial considerations are provided for the third one. © 2020 ACM.}},

However, with the presence of these systems little is known about their long-term use in the educational milieu. As a result, we conducted a survey with twelve teachers of students with visual impairments to learn about the use of these systems in teaching their students and to understand the barriers that students face in the learning process.

The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review.

  journal = {International Journal of STEM Education}},
  abstract = {Background: Educational robotics (ER) is increasingly used in classrooms to implement activities aimed at fostering the development of students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Though previous works have proposed different models and frameworks to describe the underlying concepts of CT, very few have discussed how ER activities should be implemented in classrooms to effectively foster CT skill development. Particularly, there is a lack of operational frameworks, supporting teachers in the design, implementation, and assessment of ER activities aimed at CT skill development. The current study therefore presents a model that allows teachers to identify relevant CT concepts for different phases of ER activities and aims at helping them to appropriately plan instructional interventions. As an experimental validation, the proposed model was used to design and analyze an ER activity aimed at overcoming a problem that is often observed in classrooms: the trial-and-error loop, i.e., an over-investment in programming with respect to other tasks related to problem-solving. Results: Two groups of primary school students participated in an ER activity using the educational robot Thymio. While one group completed the task without any imposed constraints, the other was subjected to an instructional intervention developed based on the proposed model. The results suggest that (i) a non-instructional approach for educational robotics activities (i.e., unlimited access to the programming interface) promotes a trial-and-error behavior; (ii) a scheduled blocking of the programming interface fosters cognitive processes related to problem understanding, idea generation, and solution formulation; (iii) progressively adjusting the blocking of the programming interface can help students in building a well-settled strategy to approach educational robotics problems and may represent an effective way to provide scaffolding. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide initial evidence on the need for specific instructional interventions on ER activities, illustrating how teachers could use the proposed model to design ER activities aimed at CT skill development. However, future work should investigate whether teachers can effectively take advantage of the model for their teaching activities. Moreover, other intervention hypotheses have to be explored and tested in order to demonstrate a broader validity of the model. © 2020, The Author(s).}},

In this model, it is not a random process from infinite superposed possibilities that exist at the quantum-level as supposed by the Copenhagen Interpretation, and as assumed as the foundation of the infinite processing capability of quantum objects by contemporary pioneers of quantum computing. Rather, the infinite processing capability is due to a more ordered display of superposition, entanglement, tunneling and annealing: superposition, as an ordered concord of light's property of presence stacked in logical arrangement by layer of light; entanglement, as a display of light's property of knowledge that occurs at a speed faster than the known speed of light; tunneling, as a display of light's property of power that allows toggling between different 'realities' in layers of light; and annealing, expressing light's property of harmony, to find an ideal minimum state among a number of realities. These four quantum phenomena derivative from an implicit and natural unity within light, engineered to maintain that unity externally, will confer quantum computation with the possibility of extraordinary processing power. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This Research-to-Practice Full Paper presents a reflective analysis of robotic literacy activities focused on children and teenagers. Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions. © 2020 IEEE.}},

We conducted a series of workshops in the primary schools of city of Joensuu in eastern Finland, focusing on training the fundamental computational thinking (CT) skills by using a programmable and interactive Teddy Bear toy. Educational robotics and physical computing devices have proved to be an efficient way to teach these skills regardless the students' age group or previous background. To assess the students' intrinsic motivation towards Teddy Bear programming, we devised a survey for workshop participants and conducted a statistical analysis to compare differences between the genders and age groups. The results of the large-scale empirical study (n=1440) show that the students at the age of 9-10 years (Grades 3-4) are significantly more motivated towards such a learning tool than the students of age 11-12 years (Grades 5-6). Furthermore, we show that especially young girls find the Teddy Bear programming motivating and they are eager to learn more.

The use of parallel software grew considerably in recent years due to the increasing availability of multi and many-core devices. The evolution of hardware and software resources collaborated for a remarkable computational processing power offered by parallel programs. However, parallel programming is taught usually in more advanced years of the undergraduate computer courses, due to its supposed prerequisites as sequential programming, operating systems, computer architectures and others. Postponing parallel programming teaching hinder students to apply parallelism other subjects, reducing the probability of these future professionals think on parallel solutions naturally. We executed 05 experiments teaching parallel programming subjects for 252 students. We analyzed whether students without prerequisites could learn parallel programming in the same level verified with students with prior computing knowledge. We used three different teaching methodologies: traditional, Problem Based Learning (PBL), and Team-Based Learning (TBL). The teaching and learning evaluation took into account such metrics: parallelism thinking of students, use of programming-model, correct output of the program, source-code readability and satisfaction of the students. The paper shows that it is possible to teach parallel programming to students without previous knowledge of computing, obtaining high scores and interest in such learning. Our results contribute positively to disseminate parallel programming, which is vital to extract performance from nowadays computers. © 2020 IEEE.}},

Gaming and interactivity have been suggested as essential features in reducing dropout and increasing persistence in online learning. Yet in interactive game-based learning environments, persistence in moving forward in the game may come at the expense of investing in each of the game’s levels. That is, the motivation to complete the game may have a deleterious effect on learning at specific levels and hence on learning from the game in general. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on microlevel persistence (i.e., persistence during each component of the learning process). We study microlevel persistence in the context of acquiring computational thinking—the thought process of solving problems through abstraction—which is a key component of the new literacies needed for tomorrow’s citizens. In this study, we analyze data collected from an online, game-based learning environment (CodeMonkey™). The data document the activity of first to sixth graders (N = 2,040).

Following scientific studies that were aimed at understanding and predicting the evolution of these systems, and fueled by technological advances, research has started to investigate CAS engineering: the methods, tools, and techniques for building CASs. This naturally leads to a vision where collectives of humans and computational elements, situated both in the digital and physical worlds, collaborate to give rise to 'intelligent' collective behavior supporting novel kinds of applications and services. Humans can be involved in two ways: both as users and as components of the CAS, in the sense that human behaviors and limitations are often integral to the system description. This has significant social implications that need to be considered by CAS researchers: in this paper, we share a discussion that took place between some experts thinking about CAS engineering, focusing on the social implication of CASs and related open research challenges.

It can evaluate the feasibility of images by constructing the computational model of human aesthetic thinking. In this paper, a color harmony evaluation method based on color complexity was implemented. Given the classical color harmony model which is suitable for the simple color combination but not suitable for the complex image, and the local feature redundancy caused by grid sampling, an adaptive sampling based on CCM(color complexity measure) was implemented. Then, K-means was adopted to extract local color harmony features. Finally, a model was constructed between local color harmony features and the overall color harmony by SVM. The results show that the method implemented in this paper can represent the color harmony of complex images accurately and effectively.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results. © 2020 IEEE.}},

The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline Algorithms and Data Structures I at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners. © 2020 IEEE.}},

In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops.

  journal = {Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE}},
  abstract = {This work in progress study aims at developing a system to designate teams to relatively large groups of students in a classroom setting. It is motivated by recent changes in the ABET Criterion 3 accreditation guideline that requires students to demonstrate an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. Outside of accreditation guidelines, team-based learning is becoming the prescribed pedagogical tool to enhance student collaboration and prepare them for professional work environments upon graduation. One important factor in effective team-based learning is to ensure teams are balanced in their abilities and characteristics across team members. Demographical memberships of students can also play an important role in team dynamics and impact the overall success in content learning. Instructors usually assign teams to students by manually looking into their abilities from previous grades and other performance factors. This can then become tedious when aiming to maintain uniform heterogeneity in classrooms of students coming from diverse backgrounds of knowledge, skills, ethnicity, and gender.While some studies have presented the use of computer-aided tools, visualization categorization, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, this work proposes the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to form teams optimized for heterogeneity. The Genetic Algorithm presented uses a discrete integer-based chromosome representation and groups alleles to represent each team. Standard GA operators enable the algorithm to be adapted to any optimizing criteria deemed fit by the instructor. The algorithm presented in this work uses self-reported competency data on 3 different computational skills for 1300 students enrolled in a firstyear engineering design thinking course divided into over 20course sections of strength 40-60 each. Net team scores for each computational tool are calculated and the variation across each skill minimized by the fitness function for individual sections. Constraints based on gender and ethnicity are applied to minimize demographical imbalance between teams. The algorithm is tested for all sections in the Fall 2019 cohort to give consistent team configuration. Discussions on the stability and validity of configurations generated are discussed. Future work include methods that use a fuzzy logic decision-making tool for multiple criteria optimization. © 2020 IEEE.}},

The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable.

Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students. © 2020 IEEE.}},

Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience.

Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs.

However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments. © 2020 IEEE.}},

Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

We summarize our 35 years of lessons learned for preparing the workforce that can inform efforts to address this challenge. We have pursued a multiprong approach to reach instructors, researchers, professionals, and students on a national scale. Our efforts in scaling up and sustaining activities range from teaching computational thinking through imparting HPC skills. We have been able to scale up these activities through community efforts to share, cooperate, and collaborate. The potential for providing life-long learning to everyone wishing to expand their computational knowledge and skills is greater than any organization can achieve on its own. © 1999-2011 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The computational metaphor of organisms as phenotypic automata controlled by a genetic programme has been replaced by the cognitive metaphor of organisms as intelligent agents making decisions about how to use their genomic and environmental resources. This metaphor facilitates novel ways of thinking about organisms that defy the assumptions of the old machine metaphor. But like all metaphors, the cognitive metaphor discloses important similarities at the expense of eclipsing significant dissimilarities. I argue that although cognitivism carries with it the crucial insight that living organisms are agents rather than mere automata, this metaphor distorts the nature of biological agency by over-intellectualizing, which risks eliminating the distinction between life and mind. I trace the Cartesian root of these metaphors and argue that it generates a dilemma between mechanism and intellectualism. To capture the middle path that most organisms occupy between these two extremes, I propose an ecological account of natural agency. © 2020 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Institute.}},

  abstract = {With the rise of Computational Thinking (CT) instruction at the elementary level, it is imperative for elementary computing instruction to support a variety of learners. TIPP&SEE is a meta-cognitive learning strategy that scaffolds student learning when learning from example code. Results from a previous study show statistically-significant performance differences favoring students using the TIPP&SEE strategy on a written assessment. In this work, our goal is gain insight as to it why such dramatic learning differences may have occurred. We analyze the students' computational artifacts and TIPP&SEE worksheets. Artifact analysis reveals that students in the TIPP&SEE group are more thorough in their work, completing more elements of the required tasks. In addition, they build open-ended projects with longer scripts that utilize more learned blocks. Worksheet analysis shows that students were highly accurate on some types of questions but largely skipped others. Despite these positive behaviors, there was little statistical correlation between student worksheet correctness, project completion, and written assessment performance. Therefore, while students in the TIPP&SEE group performed actions we believe lead to more success, no individual actions directly explain the results. Like other meta-cognitive strategies, the value of TIPP&SEE may lie in cognitive processes not directly observable, and may vary based upon individual student differences. © 2020 ACM.}},

  abstract = {One of the shortcomings of many modern serious games and medical simulations lies in their inability to model even some modicum of unpredictability of real life situations. Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.  © 2020 IEEE.}},

  journal = {ICER 2020 - Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research}},
  abstract = {Empathy is a humanistic skill, a capacity that allows us to perceive other people's emotions, putting ourselves under their perspective [1]. The study of empathy is highlighted as a tool to provide a better understanding of people's thoughts, feelings and how they affect behavior [2]. Being aware of that, a design company created the Empathy Map (EM), which is usually employed in the initial phase of the Design Thinking process to understand user's concerns, feelings and aspirations [3]. Teaching practices known as student-centered, inherited from the constructivist school, are not new [4]. Several educators have applied these approaches inside the Computer Science (CS) classroom [5]. A key to success in CS education is the construction of the computational thinking [5]. Learning to program is not an easy task and the process is surrounded by several emotional reactions such as frustration, anxiety, happiness and others [6]. In this sense, EMs can be useful to capture student's feelings, guiding educators strategies during CS classes. Here, I describe the experience of using the EM inside the Computer Science classroom at the University Center Barão de Mauá. The process of building EMs involves the description of the persona, who, in this case, are the students of a given year in the CS course. In the center of EM, the picture of a student is drawn and the surrounding region is divided into 4 areas [3, 7]: 1) THINK and FEEL - What are the students thinking/feeling? 2) HEAR and SEE - What are the students hearing/seeing? 3) SAY and DO - What are the students saying/doing? 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES and GAINS - What are the challenges the students are facing? Is there anything painful to do? How do they measure success? The EM was performed in two different stages of the CS course: in the first and third years. The students were asked to build the EM, representing their feelings and aspirations about CS. The EM of the first year showed: 1) THINK and FEEL - "thinking about the future", "feeling fear", "curiosity", "insecurity", "confusion". 2) HEAR and SEE - "hearing positive statements from family and friends", "seeing themselves in a trainee program", "working or doing a master's degree", "developing themselves". They also reported to hear that CS is very difficult. 3) SAY and DO - They say learning is difficult, They do study and work; 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES - they report feeling insecure about finishing the course and find a position. The main challenge is to conciliate both working and studies. The students of the third year reported: 1) THINK and FEEL - "thinking about the future", "feeling anxiety", "anger", "tiredness", "worry"; 2) HEAR and SEE - "they hear that CS is a promising career", "see opportunities and/or lack of them". They reported hear questions about what they will do in the future; 3) SAY and DO - "procrastinating and working"; 4) PAIN/CHALLENGES - The pain reported refers to the anxiety of completing the course and the excessive procrastination. The main challenge reported was to set medium/short term goals as study to complete tasks in the CS course. As a conclusion, we highlight that the first year students were more motivated about their future, whereas the third year are tired and anxious about finishing the course. The EM construction was able to show student's feelings and pains about the course, allowing the educator to capture the student's perspectives. Based on that, it may be possible to conduct a more appropriate learning plan to manage how emotional aspects can influence the learning process. As a future work, EM will be used along with specific subjects in a qualitative study, considering subjects with highest failure rates in CS curriculum. © 2020 Owner/Author.}},

However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for schoolchildren, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory - IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities. © 2020 IEEE.}},

Aim: This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results: Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion: The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

Our findings show that this approach does balance structure with flexibility and creativity, allowing teachers wide variation in the degree to which they adhere to the structured tasks. Many students utilized recently-learned blocks in open-ended activities, yet they also explored blocks not formally taught. In addition, they took advantage of open-ended projects to change sprites, backgrounds, and integrate narratives into their projects. © 2020 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Making programmable physical artefacts and prototypes has inherent value for Research-through-Design (RtD) based HCI. Furthermore, the abstractions and representations within RtD and programming are vastly different, such as between observations, storyboards and the code. Studies have shown that the program of an artefact influences the RtD outcome, but there is also a disconnect between the observations of use and the abstractions involved in the programming. How can we program an artefact so that the code can be created, modified and reflected upon based on directly observable and non-technical abstractions? In this paper we present Storycoding, a computational-thinking based method for programming that focuses on bridging the representational abstractions. Using Storycoded artefacts, we examine programming in light of RtD. We discuss how Storycoding enables programming that is directly observable between the use and the abstractions, being respectful towards RtD. Finally, we conclude with implications towards HCI research and practice. © 2020 ACM.}},

Based on the teaching experience of frontline teachers who have been teaching in general high schools for 18 years and the analysis of China's latest curriculum standards and core literacy requirements in information technology, this paper explores how general high schools can achieve sustainable C++ education program. At the curriculum level, combining the characteristics of C++ and students' developmental needs, two series of courses are formed: the General Studies Series and the Competition Series, the General Studies Series feature "wide range of content"and "real problem-driven"; the Competition Series featuring "deep"and "classic problems of computer science algorithms". At the teaching level, putting "problem understanding", "algorithm design", "algorithm experimentation and analysis"and "algorithm thinking communication"at the core of teaching practice, in stages and according to the types of students, differential teaching strategies are adopted, attaching importance to the problem context design and algorithm design, and emphasizing the process of "computational thinking"of the students.

The key features of the adaptive model supported by the online system are algorithmic questions, availability, contextualization, immediate feedback, interactive feedback, and open answers. These features are portable across subject domains, so the system can be adapted to include new subjects.

Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users.

  journal = {International Journal of Architectural Computing}},
  abstract = {Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it. © The Author(s) 2020.}},

Twelve third graders (six males and six females) voluntarily participated in an experiment-based computer class conducted at a public elementary school in Taiwan. This study adopted a case study methodology to investigate research questions in one specific case (8-week CT educational training). A one-group quasi-experimental pretest and posttest design with the support of qualitative observation was used to examine four research topics: CT competence progress, programming behaviors in a CT framework, factors influencing CT competence, and learning responses to CT training. The quantitative results indicated that students immersing in weekly programming projects significantly improved in terms of their CT competence, which was mostly retained 1 month after completion of the class. The programming behaviors indicated that students’ CT concepts (sequence, event, and parallelism) and practice (testing and debugging as well as reusing and remixing) significantly improved. Moreover, parents’ active involvement in take-home assignments influenced students’ long-term CT competence retention. The qualitative results indicated that students enjoyed using tablet computers to learn ScratchJr programming and demonstrated various leaning behaviors in a three-stage instructional design model. © The Author(s) 2019.}},

Much CT focus on abstraction naturally emphasizes (1) extraction of a set of features from an object or process, and (2) finding commonality between objects and processes. But Rosen [38] encourages us to think about abstraction as also including the production of new concepts or actions. Integrating CT into science offers the possibility of enhancing this aspect of abstraction. Changing the representational affordances available to the students allows them to take their CT thinking beyond learning-to-abstract towards learning-throughabstraction.

A particular focus is using the school library and media center as a site to complement and enhance classroom instruction on coding. Further, our approach builds upon unplugged knowledge and practices that are already familiar to and motivating for students, in this case tabletop board games. Through these games, students can use their prior knowledge and ease with tabletop gaming mechanics to cue relevant ideas for core computational concepts. We describe a model and an instructional unit spanning across classroom and school library settings that builds upon board game play as a source domain for computing knowledge. Building on expansive framing, the model emphasizes instructional linkages being made between one domain (the tabletop board game) and another (specially designed Scratch project shells with partially complete code blocks) such that the reasoning activities and different contexts are seen as instantiations of the same encompassing context. We present the experiences of three elementary school teachers as they implemented the unit in their classrooms and with their school librarian. We also show initial findings on the impact of the unit on student interest (N=87), as measured by preand post- surveys.

Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computer science for all initiatives have broadened the participation of students enrolled in elective computer science (CS) courses and introduced compulsory CS instruction in many areas of the United States. However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The common approach for introducing middle school and high school students to computational thinking and engineering is through programming or robotics activities that were designed without much social context. Therefore, one of the challenges such outreach programs pose is further stereotyping of students who are interested in computer science, by presenting them as people who ought to be hyper-intelligent and very much focused on computers with no social skills. Realizing the above, and wanting to attract a diverse audience to study computer science, we developed a one-day workshop which showcases the interdisciplinary nature of computer science and the various ways computing can help students discover and solve societal problems. We chose multiculturalism, cyber security and air pollution as the context of our computational thinking activities. This paper describes our experiences in developing and teaching the workshops that runs three to five times a year, hosted either in our institute or at local schools. Regardless of students' previous STEM experiences and socioeconomic statuses, both students and teachers reported that the knowledge gained enabled them to either create a computer program or a robot and also led to a better understanding of how computers can be used in daily life. In other words, the workshop successfully opened the minds and perspectives of the middle school and high school students on computer science. Additionally, over time, we also observed an increased number of students and schools participating in such workshops. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This course was based on materials developed from a previous program that trained high school teachers in computational thinking and programming through LSU's Cain Center. Pedagogical content knowledge informed the design of this course. Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch. The transition from the CS curriculum taught in high schools to what follows in college needs to be smoother. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures. © 2008-2011 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Given the academic diversity of today's classrooms, elementary teachers engaged in computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) instruction must create CS/CT experiences that are accessible and engaging to a broad range of learners, including those with disabilities. One method of developing inclusive instructional experiences is through the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework, wherein teachers proactively design instruction for the broadest range of learners. Doing so may be challenging as elementary teachers may not be familiar with the UDL framework or may not have experience with applying UDL within CS/CT instruction. The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate how four elementary teachers provided UDL-based instruction to academically diverse learners during CS/CT instruction. Teachers received professional development and instructional coaching related to UDL within CS/CT education. Data included teachers' lesson plans, coaching logs, and teacher interviews which were qualitatively analyzed and triangulated. Data revealed that teachers generally addressed all three UDL principles, with an emphasis on two of the principles (multiple means of engagement and multiple means of representing content) above the third principle (multiple means of action and expression). They focused on breaking tasks into steps, emphasizing student choice, and presenting information in multiple ways. Findings revealed nuanced implementation differences among the teachers as well. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.}},

Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design.

In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential. © 2020 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The ever-increasing computational requirements of HPC and service provider applications are becoming a great challenge for hardware and software designers. These requirements are reaching levels where the isolated development on either computational field is not enough to deal with such challenge. A holistic view of the computational thinking is therefore the only way to success in real scenarios. However, this is not a trivial task as it requires, among others, of hardware–software codesign. In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards.

This paper presents a study of college students solving a problem unrelated to their academic majors. The analysis suggests that the educational experiences of Computer Science (CS) students may better train them in problem-solving than the experiences of other majors. In this study, students from a variety of undergraduate majors and grade levels were given a 15-minute problem-solving task embedded in an interactive science simulation. The complex task calls upon many problem-solving practices needed by scientists and engineers in their professions. Although this task has little resemblance to the problems encountered in a computer science course, CS students performed significantly better than students in any other major. In addition, only for CS students was there an indication of improvement in problem-solving from lower to upper grade levels. We propose that general problem-solving and computational thinking share some common practices, such as problem decomposition and comprehensive data collection. Furthermore, we present preliminary evidence that training in computational thinking is transferable to problem-solving tasks across domains and discuss how the unique features of CS programming assignments could be generalized to other science and engineering courses to foster students' general problem-solving skills. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The pre- and post-test results show that the interventions helped students learn cybersecurity and CT concepts, but they had difficulties with networking concepts. These results correlate with scores from the game and the final challenge. Overall, surveys show that the competition-based robotics learning framework was engaging to students, and it supported their learning. However, our intervention needs to be modified to help students learn networking concepts. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computer Science (CS) is a profession that positively impacts every single area of society without which today's world would come to a complete halt. Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on 'waste management'.

  abstract = {Recent studies of creative cognition have revealed interactions between functional brain networks involved in the generation of novel ideas; however, the neural basis of creativity is highly complex and presents a great challenge in the field of cognitive neuroscience, partly because of ambiguity around how to assess creativity. We applied a novel computational method of verbal creativity assessment—semantic distance— and performed weighted degree functional connectivity analyses to explore how individual differences in assembly of resting-state networks are associated with this objective creativity assessment. To measure creative performance, a sample of healthy adults (n = 175) completed a battery of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, in which they were asked to think of unusual uses for everyday objects. Computational semantic models were applied to calculate the semantic distance between objects and responses to obtain an objective measure of DT performance. All participants underwent resting-state imaging, from which we computed voxel-wise connectivity matrices between all gray matter voxels. A linear regression analysis was applied between DT and weighted degree of the connectivity matrices. Our analysis revealed a significant connectivity decrease in the visual-temporal and parietal regions, in relation to increased levels of DT. Link-level analyses showed higher local connectivity within visual regions was associated with lower DT, whereas projections from the precuneus to the right inferior occipital and temporal cortex were positively associated with DT. Our results demonstrate differential patterns of resting-state connectivity associated with individual creative thinking ability, extending past work using a new application to automatically assess creativity via semantic distance. © 2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}},

  abstract = {The basic cognitive architecture of our brain is still unknown. However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

  journal = {Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-based Learning}},
  abstract = {Students repeatedly find programming a complex subject to grasp and this can be compounded when teaching within a computer game context. Comprehending the concept of programming beyond the syntax of the chosen programming language can present many barriers for the student to overcome. Students frequently associate the term "programming" with the creation of "text-based" language-specific code neglecting the associated problem-solving activities of developing pseudocode algorithms, computational thinking, problem identification and pattern recognition. Specialising the programming for games can persuade students to neglect problem-solving activities and perceive the programming fundamentals taught in introductory first-level courses as not applicable. Suggesting that the teaching methodology employed at an introductory level does not meet the needs of the student. Various academic studies would suggest there is a need for an approach to programming that brings together as many, if not all, the cognitive aspects of programming - pseudocode algorithms, computational thinking, problem identification, pattern recognition as well as the development of coded solutions. The Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify and Make (PRIMM) approach carefully developed for effective use in schools lends itself nicely for use in a game programming setting. The PRIMM approach is predicated on the spheres of programming research - Use-Modify-Create, Levels of Abstraction, and reading and tracing code for understanding. It provides a framework for the educator to administer "scaffolded" and directed exercises to the student to aid their understanding. Although developed as a general pedagogy for teaching the fundamental aspects of programming, the methodology provides an approach that could improve the teaching and delivery of game programming modules. This paper will discuss an initial attempt to improve the teaching and student understanding of games programming through the application of the PRIMM methodology to the module delivery. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

  abstract = {This paper presents research about supporting primary school teachers in planning game based learning activities in different school subjects. Teachers can describe learning activities in the form of a learning scenario, which usually includes a list of learning outcomes, teaching methods and strategies, materials, and tools for achieving the learning outcomes. The process of designing a learning scenario can be challenging for teachers, especially those with a lack of ICT skills. Teachers should be familiar with the various ICT based teaching methods, strategies, contents and tools. Therefore, it is necessary to organize educational programmes to support teachers in acquiring appropriate knowledge and skills. The paper describes results of the study conducted during the education for primary school junior grade teachers organized within the Erasmus+ project GLAT that promotes development of algorithmic thinking using games. The aim of the study was to identify the level of participants' knowledge and skills needed to design scenarios with game based learning activities for developing algorithmic and computational thinking among their students. Using questionnaires, the teachers' self-assessment of familiarity with the terminology related to game based learning and possibilities of adapting and using digital contents, games and tools was determined as well as their self-assessment of progress made during the education. Teachers' progress was realized to the greatest extent for elements related to games, learning scenarios, and applying Web 2.0 tools for learning activities. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the GLAT instructional model and showed that teachers need support not only through education, but also by providing ICT tools that will make the process of designing learning scenarios easier for them. Therefore, a future work in this direction is planned within the project Digital games and will include development of a web application for guiding teachers in the process of designing innovative game based learning scenarios. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

  abstract = {Game development-based learning and creative coding activities are seen as an opportunity for young people to acquire programming skills and overall, Computational Thinking (CT) skills in an entertaining way. The goal of such activities is to create playable gaming artefacts. While learning to code is becoming more and more important, young game design-ers miss a clear map to know how game and design elements can be organized and in which situations, specific elements or structures are appropriate. The aim of this paper is to present a valid assessment for structuring games created with visual coding languages. In different workshop settings (out-off school workshops, school workshops) 84 participants between 10 and 15 years old have individually created gaming applications with our Catrobat environment. Games created during these workshops (2017-2019) were analysed and structured in game elements, design elements, and game complexity. This method is based on various existing frameworks, for example, the Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics (MDA) framework, which provide a consistent structure to define game elements, goals, and rules, thereby delivering a common framework and vocabulary for games. The transfer of game concepts in a consistent structure should support the overall clarity of the game and should help to focus students on the relevant elements of games. We argue that students need guidelines to be able to implement more complex games even with visual programming languages. The result, the Playing, Engagement, Creativity, and Creating (PECC) Assessment Template should support the process of evaluating gaming apps in visual coding languages, can be used by researchers as a valid method for structuring games, helps all students to adhere to good game design principles, and teachers can use the analysis to evaluate games created with visual programming languages. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered to be a fundamental skill underlying not only programming ability, but also an entire array of computational problem-solving competencies in a data-driven world. The need for accessible and engaging educational tools for CT has recently been acknowledged as significant by educational authorities. Glitchspace is a first-person puzzle game where the player has to manipulate objects in the game world through a visual programming interface in order to escape the cybermaze and win. The game received critical acclaim for its innovative and engaging gameplay, including a British Academy Scotland Award (BAFTA). However, the educational potential of Glitchspace in relation to CT ability has not been sufficiently explored. As success at playing the game relies on the players' ability to program the game world to suit their goals, it is hypothesised that common measurements of CT will positively correlate with game ability (measured by game metrics, such as completion times and number of failed attempts of various sub-tasks). We propose to develop methodologies to explore the relationship between gameplay behaviour and computational problem-solving ability in the game Glitchspace. Such methodologies will allow researchers to investigate which game mechanics elicit and promote CT in a reliable and measurable way. The outcome of this research will be of great value to instructional designers seeking to leverage games for CT education, as well as learning game analysts seeking to map gameplay behaviour to learning outcomes. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot. The children have successfully improved in both fundamental programming constructs and emotional intelligence skills.

Arduino arises from current technological innovations with the intention of promoting a new approach to learning through machines. The objective of this research is to analyze the evolution of the Arduino concept in the scientific literature. To achieve this aim, a bibliometric methodology based on scientific mapping and an analysis of co-words has been used. The scientific production of Arduino indexed in Web of Science has been analyzed. We have worked with an analysis unit of 346 documents. The results of this research show that the scientific production on Arduino in the field of education starts in 2010 until today. The communications in the congresses to present the results of the investigations developed are the most used means of diffusion. The National University of Distance Education and the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu are particularly noteworthy. The authors with more scientific production in this field of study are Bogdan, M. and Castro, M. It is significant that the collection of studies on this subject is carried out, above all, by EDULEARN Proceedings and INTED Proceedings. It can be concluded that the field of study on Arduino in the educational field is relatively recent, so that today, the basis for scientific research is still being established. However, the most relevant aspects in this field of study are physic experiments, computational thinking and computer-based learning.  © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Today's digital society has turned the development of students' computational thinking capabilities into a critical factor for their future success. As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim. © 2013 IEEE.}},

The main initiative promoted is the strengthening of skills and competencies in programming and computational thinking. This article evidences the effect of a training program on educational robotics on the acquisition of computational thinking and programming skills in young children. The research design is quasi-experimental, with pretest and post-test measures, with an experimental and control group. The sample of participants consists of 46 students of the first year of Primary Education, with age between 6 and 7 years, belonging to a Spanish educational centre. Computational thinking is measured through the dimensions: algorithmic thinking sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used in the intervention sessions were an adaptation of the training actions proposed in the robotics study program “TangibleK”. The results obtained in this study reveal positive effects concerning the performance achieved by the participants in the activities carried out. This indicates a significant effect on the strengthening of skills linked to computational thinking. The differences found between the pretest and post-test measures of the experimental group are statistically significant and superior to those presented by the control group. In this way, it was concluded that the participants of the training program in robotics and programming obtain a more significant advance in the three dimensions of the computational competence explored. © 2020 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Lacking student preparation before class has been the most commonly identified challenge when adopting the flipped classroom approach. In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented.

  journal = {International Journal of STEM Education}},
  abstract = {Background: There have been increasing calls for integrating computational thinking and computing into school science, mathematics, and engineering classrooms. The learning goals of the curriculum in this study included learning about both computational thinking and climate science. Including computer science in science classrooms also means a shift in the focus on design and creation of artifacts and attendant practices. One such design practice, widespread in the design and arts fields, is critique. This paper explores the role of critique in two urban, heterogenous 8th grade science classrooms in which students engaged in creating computer games on the topic of climate systems and climate change. It explores and compares how practices of critique resulted from curricular decisions to (i) scaffold intentional critique sessions for student game designers and (ii) allow for spontaneous feedback as students interacted with each other and their games during the process of game creation. Results: Although we designed formal opportunities for critique, the participatory dimension of the project meant that students were free to critique each other’s games at any time during the building process and did so voluntarily. Data indicate that students focused much more on the game play dimension of the design than the science, particularly in those critique sessions that were student-initiated. Despite the de-emphasis on science in spontaneous critiques, students still focused on several dimensions of computational thinking, considering user experience, troubleshooting, modeling, and elegance of solutions. Conclusions: Students making games about science topics should have opportunities for both formal and spontaneous critiques. Spontaneous critiques allow for students to be authorities of knowledge and to determine what is acceptable and what is not. However, formal, teacher-designed critiques may be necessary for students to focus on science as part of the critique. Furthermore, one of the benefits to critiquing others was that students were able to see what others had done, how they had set up their games, the content they included, and how they had programmed certain features. Lastly, critiques can help facilitate iteration as students work to improve their games. © 2019, The Author(s).}},

  abstract = {Computer scientists have been working towards a common definition of abstraction; however, the instruction and assessment of abstraction remain categorically under-researched. Abstraction is often cited as a component of computational thinking and can be likened to a higher order thinking skill. Most K-12 educators have studied critical thinking (e.g., Bloom's taxonomy, Marzano & Kendall's new taxonomy) more than computational thinking. Overlapping characteristics of abstraction and critical thinking can provide educators with instructional guidance. The qualitative examination of how teachers determine curriculum, deliver instruction, and design assessments in K-12 computer science education contributes insights into current instructional practices and variables for future quantitative study. The instructional strategies, objectives, and assessments of 12 K-12 computer science teachers from three states in the United States were examined in this descriptive qualitative examination of instruction using thematic coding analysis. The majority of teachers interviewed had little to no professional development regarding teaching abstraction. All teachers in the study were unsure what student abstraction abilities should be according to grade level. Teachers' understanding of abstraction ranged from very little knowledge to very knowledgeable. The majority of teachers interviewed did not assess abstraction intentionally. Teachers described successfully teaching abstraction through multiple instructional practices and spiraling curriculum. This examination of abstraction in K-12 computer science education offers practical descriptive insights and illuminates additional variables for researching the instruction of abstraction qualitatively and quantitatively.

Such objectives are integrated each other, since the improvement in the teaching and learning processes will not be restricted in the proposal and use of a practical framework for the improvement of students' skills in the computational thinking, but also in the use of the m-learning features and applications to improve educational issues faced by both students and teachers. In this perspective, active-learning and problem-based learning theories were considered to support the proposal of a series of activities composing a framework to be adopted to achieve the target objectives. The interdisciplinary teaching and learning processes improvement has its roots at the proposal of solutions for problems into disciplines of high school curricula through the innovative m-learning features to be designed and developed by the students. In this paper it is discussed the motivations about the proposal of this project, the teaching and learning implications in the context of a integrated course of informatics in high school course, its planning and a pilot conduction of mainly initial activities with the volunteers students.

This study contributes to the growing body of research on computation in engineering education by introducing computational concepts and activities during a physics laboratory class. Drawing from Experiential Learning Theory and using an adapted version of the Use-Modify-Create framework for teaching computational thinking, a series of lab activities was designed that combined physical lab experiments with computational modeling using custom-built VPython simulations. Data was collected from the labs in the form of (1) responses to lab activity worksheets, (2) code modified and/or generated by the students during lab activities, (3) in-code comments provided by the students during the activities. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze students' learning benefits and any challenges faced during the activities. While results show a number of learning benefits, an observed homogeneity of student responses to the questions on the lab handouts point to a set of potential limitations within the activities themselves that warranted further examination.

  abstract = {This study explores interactions between computational thinking, gender and engineering identity among biomedical engineering undergraduate students. Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, 'engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers. © 2019 IEEE.}},

Within the discipline of computer science, problem decomposition is recognized as a foundational activity of software development. Factors that contribute to the complexity of this activity include: (1) recognizing patterns within an algorithm, (2) mapping the understanding of an algorithm to the syntax of a given programming language, and (3) complexity intrinsic to the problem domain itself.Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain. Performance on outcome measures (a quiz and assignment) were compared between the new method and the traditional teaching method demonstrated that students were significantly more successful at demonstrating mastery when using the new instructional method. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This paper is focused on the teaching/learning process of Computational Thinking at primary and secondary schools. It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts 'Computational Thinking' and 'Programming', and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {We are witnessing a great effort on the part of the educational systems of the world in modernizing the curricular content of primary and secondary schools. One example of these educational initiatives is the effort of integrating aspects of engineering and technology with the existing core subjects of sciences and mathematic in K-12 education. These efforts are often labeled as STEM or STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Arts.) These subjects, studied in an integral form, are considered essential in the education of the citizens of a modern society. A common obstacle encountered in the implementation of these projects or initiatives is the lack of consensus on the specific topics to be included in the curriculum, the pedagogical methodology selected for the classroom, and the means, computer-based or otherwise, to be used by the teachers and the students. Often the lack of consensus among the different constituencies in charge of these projects finds its roots in the different assumptions made by their participants. This paper addresses one of the most acute set of differences present in these projects: the teaching methods used in class, knowing the resources and limitations of the human mind. In the last few decades we have learned much of how the mind works; what tasks are intrinsically easy or difficult for the human mind. Also, with the extensive access to computing power in our society, it is important to determine if a traditional task was studied in school for its practical use or for its value in developing the potential qualities of the mind. In this paper we will use the word computation in its traditional meaning of symbol manipulation. In that sense, all processes of thinking, solving problems, and endeavors of creation are processes of symbol manipulation, or computation. In this paper we present a computational model of the mind in order to provide a standard reference that will help in finding answers to questions such as: when is a task complex, what are the cognitive capabilities and limitations of the mind, what teaching methodologies are optimal, and why. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools. © 2019 IEEE.}},

The research was conducted attuned to the ethical guidelines of educational research, within the framework of the physical and natural science courses and evolved around three axes: (a) Checking the validity and the reliability of the results that come out when applying the proposed assessment tool. (b) Designating the levels of computational thinking skills of students at first stages of schooling.

  abstract = {This study explored how Australian music technology courses teach employability skills. A curriculum mapping of 63 undergraduate courses was conducted with course learning outcomes aligned against two benchmarks. The first benchmark was the Ten Skills for the Future Workforce which identifies key employability skills graduates will require in the coming decade. The second benchmark was the Australian Qualifications Framework Specification for the Bachelor Degree which defines the generic skills graduates must obtain through Australian Bachelor Degrees. This curriculum mapping reveals that Australian music technology courses teach Novel and Adaptive Thinking, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, and Design Mindsets universally. However, this curriculum mapping also reveals a deficit in employability skills related to Cross-Cultural Competency, Transdisciplinarity, Virtual Collaboration, and Collaboration more generally. The implications of this mapping is that Australian music technology educators seem to be prioritizing specific technical and creative skills over higher-order applications of skills and knowledge which are contextualized in their broader social and cultural contexts. Finally, this article shows how curriculum mapping can be implemented to embed employability skills progressively across a program sequence using a case study from the School of Music, University of Queensland. © The Author(s) 2019.}},

Classifying learners/teams in the behavioral feature space with respect to the task performance gives insight into the behavior patterns relevant for high performance, which could be backed by feature ranking. As a use case, we present an open-ended learning activity using tangible haptic-enabled Cellulo robots in a classroom-level setting. The pilot study, spanning over approximately an hour, is conducted with 25 children in teams of two that are aged between 11-12. A linear separation is observed between the high and low performing teams where two of the behavioral features, namely number of distinct attempts and the visits to the destination, are found to be important.

  abstract = {This article takes inspiration from Kittler’s claim that philosophy has neglected the means used for its production. Kittler’s argument for media ontology will be compared to the post-Kantian project of re-inventing philosophy through the medium of thought (in particular Deleuze’s Spiritual Automaton). The article discusses these views in the context of the automation of logical thinking where procedures, tasks, and functions are part of the instrumental processing of new ends evolving a new mode of reasoning. In particular, the article suggests that in constructivist logic and information theory, the temporal gap between truth and proof, between input and output, can be taken to argue that the means of thought expose the indetermination or the incomputability of proof. The automation of reasoning in logical processing coincides not with mindless correlations of data, replacing axioms with data, truths with self-validating proofs. Instead, the problem of the indeterminacy of proof within automated logic re-habilitates techne or instrumentality, and the relation between means and ends away from classical idealism and analytic realism. By following John Dewey’s argument for instrumentality, it will be argued that the task of thinking today needs to re-invent a logic of techne away from the teleological view of ends or the crisis of finality. If the post-Kantian preoccupations about the task of thinking already announced that the medium of thought could offer possibilities for a non-human philosophy (or a philosophy beyond truth), this article envisions a machine philosophy originating from within computational media. © The Author(s) 2019.}},

With the above motivation, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with instructors who teach introductory programming courses and we also collected diaries kept by 110 students during their studies. The qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. Our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially.

A positive self-concept in science and mathematics is argued to motivate students to persist and advance in studying these subjects. In particular, self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards STEM domains were found to be predictive of educational achievement. Recently, programming was suggested to be a key competence in education. To assess self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming, we developed a new questionnaire based on existing scales for mathematics. The new questionnaire assesses the same aspects for programming on seven subscales, such as self-concept, belief about usefulness, and self-reported persistence when working on programming tasks. We conducted a pilot study in which we used this questionnaire to measure self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming. The study was set in the context of an extracurricular course on computational thinking (CT) for elementary school students between the ages of seven and ten years. Before the start of the course, we assessed all 31 participating students' self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming using the developed questionnaire and their CT skills using the Computational Thinking test (CTt). Our results confirmed the expected associations between the aspects assessed by our questionnaire. However, we did not find significant associations of questionnaire results and CT skills. Consequently, future research involving a larger sample is needed to better understand the association between children's actual performance and their self-concept, motivational beliefs, and attitudes towards programming. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

The Library, as a discipline-Agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines. Building on this strong partnership and leveraging the Library's resources and expertise in digital literacy, the campus can better support data-driven and technologically-focused education and research. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Proponents of computing education have long stressed the value of computing for learning in other disciplines. Much of the research towards this end has focused on supporting learning in science, engineering, and mathematics (or STEM). However, a trend towards computing in non-STEM disciplines is growing, yet the research base is more limited. We add to this emerging area of research by investigating the potential for integrating computing and literacy education. This paper reports the results of a six-week intervention during an after-school program in a British primary school. We describe the development of a curriculum unit and report on the first iterative cycle in a design-based research project. Our analysis shows that integrating programming and literacy activities supported novice learners in areas of computing such as algorithm design and program execution through a combination of short problem-based tasks and longer project-based activities. Likewise, programming supported learners in creating digital stories by visualizing narrative structure though some caveats were found. We discuss the results of this study and implications for future work in this area. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.}},

  abstract = {To better understand the nature, function and elicitation conditions of emotion it is important to approach studying emotion from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychology, neuroscience and affective computing. Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret-a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence-is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which-after new reward evidence-an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking. © 2019 IEEE.}},

Despite its increasing popularity, the construct itself is only partially understood. There are few measures currently in place that advance our understanding of computational thinking and its sub-constructs. In this article, we analyze existing measures of computational thinking (CT), looking specifically at their measures of decomposition. Decomposition is defined as the process of breaking down a problem into its sub-components. Even though most definitions of computational thinking include decomposition, few break down the decompositional process beyond a basic definition. As one of the first steps in the computational thinking process, it is important to better understand the various manners in which decomposition occurs, which methods are most effective, and under what conditions. To better understand the decompositional process, we analyze evidence of decompositional process in a variety of disciplines. We then present a framework for decomposition in computational thinking. We demonstrate how this framework may help educators to better prepare students to break down complex problems, as well as provide guidance for how decompositional ability might be measured. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

With the promulgation of the domestic high school information technology curriculum standards in 2017, the formulation and positioning requirements of the core literacy of the disciplines, computational thinking as one of the four core literacy, is the thinking ability that everyone should have. Many foreign educational practice studies have shown that mind mapping can effectively promote students' cognitive development and knowledge construction. However, the domestic educational application research is relatively lacking in this aspect, and there is little research on the comprehensive and in-depth combination of it and the core literacy 'computational thinking' of the specific information technology discipline. To this end, based on the research status at home and abroad, this paper attempts to use the concept map tool to represent several important functions of computational thinking, 'definition of problems', 'abstract function', 'build model' and 'Debugging and improvement'. The diagram incorporates the teaching model in the computational thinking development curriculum.

Prior work has delved into the problem of underrepresentation in STEM and specifically in Computing Education to uncover the barriers impacting these groups. Yet, attraction and retention remains a challenge. I argue that while formal learning pathways are critical to increasing participation of diverse learners, it is also integral to provide informal and non-formal learning opportunities as well. My research uses mixed-methods within a design-based research approach to offer and evaluate an active learning beginners’ programming workshop called Code For Her. The workshop is designed to introduce females and gender-diverse individuals to web development. My goal is to analyze participants’ experiences and progress within a trajectory framework, producing a narrative of their behaviors and attitudes over both short-term and longer-term intervals. In a pilot study of the workshop design, I observed increases in self-efficacy and positive attitudes, as well as changes in ways of thinking about computing. I note that the brief exposure of a workshop may seed understanding and skills in computation, but is not likely to convert non-programmers into programmers. Instead, I am exploring a new construct - computational grounding - that refers to participants’ enhanced orientation toward computing-related behaviors. I will operationalize and study this construct using the workshop activities, thereby enhancing discussions of computational thinking. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology.

  abstract = {The promotion of Computational Thinking principles at different levels of education enables the development of practical competencies for software development. Several off-the-shelf technologies exist to promote computational abilities with the support of blockbased programming and working hardware. However, in some contexts, a significant limitation is the complexity and costs that carry the acquisition and implementation of working hardware such as Educational Robots. In this paper, we discuss a strategy to reinforce the learning of Computational Thinking (CT) skills by providing an analogous method to Educational Robots. We offer an affordable solution to assist high school students to build a CT-based software/hardware integrated solution. We executed this strategy in a coding bootcamp where students were required to design and implement an algorithm, and illustrate its execution in software and hardware. The proposed exercise delivered the expected results engaging students to ideate the solution of a problem, implement an algorithm, and create a physical demonstration of it. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. There have been various approaches to teach computational thinking in early education stages that utilize modern technologies, such as physical computing and robotics, and adopt a playful manner. Mobile Augmented Reality is a promising technology along this path that lets users collaborate and interact with both physical and digital elements. However, the technology is still relatively new and has not been studied extensively with students, especially in formal educational settings.

  abstract = {The increasing demand for higher data rates and for more connected devices has led to Massive MIMO (MMIMO) Technology. The large number of antennas makes the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector infeasible to be implemented due to high complexity, despite its optimal performance. Sphere Decoder (SD) has a bit error rate (BER) performance similar to ML detector, therefore making it more efficient (0.5-1.25 dB gain) than Linear Detectors (LD), proposed in the literature. However, the low complexity of LD and the non-deterministic behavior of SD are the main reasons that prohibit the use of sphere decoding methods in MMIMO systems. The results of this paper disrupt conventional thinking and show that there may be a future for SD in certain MMIMO system. The number of visited nodes during detection and the Initial Radius (IR) method are crucial for the computational complexity of SD. In this paper, an effective IR method, decreasing significantly the complexity and the number of visited nodes is proposed. Furthermore an optimization at tree searching further reduces the number of visited nodes, where in combination with an implementation featured with one-node-per-cycle architecture minimize the latency and make the SD attainable to large-scale systems for Eb/N0≥ 4 dB.

Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking.

  abstract = {Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures.We measured students' perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task.We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

Furthermore, it provides a way for instructors to work examples in class that focus on the process of devising the code-instructors can show how to come up with the code, rather than just showing an example.

The goal of many of these interventions is to develop a set of underlying abilities that has been termed computational thinking (CT). This goal presents a key challenge for assessing student learning: we must identify assessment items associated with an emergent understanding of key cognitive abilities underlying CT that avoid specialized knowledge of specific programming languages. In this work we explore the psychometric properties of assessment items appropriate for use with middle grades (US grades 6-8; ages 11-13) students. We also investigate whether these items measure a single ability dimension. Finally, we strive to recommend a “lean” set of items that can be completed in a single 50-minute class period and have high face validity.

We designed a game called Flexbox Froggy, in which learners solve challenges by writing a few lines of CSS code, moving from simple levels that require knowledge of one flexbox property, to complex levels combining multiple properties. We investigate learning curves based on the changes in syntactic and semantic errors learners make as they complete the game. Our findings show that people performed better encountering a single new property than combined with properties they had already practiced. Clusters of learners at different levels did not demonstrate expected error rates based on learning curve theory. Also unexpectedly, advanced groups that mastered syntax had higher semantic error rates than the beginner group, especially when attempting new properties or complex use cases.

The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games. © 2019 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {As machines have become increasingly smart and have entangled human thinking with artificial intelligences, it seems no longer possible to distinguish among levels of decision-making that occur in the newly formed space between critical reasoning, logical inference and sheer calculation. Since the 1980s, computational systems of information processing have evolved to include not only deductive methods of decision, whereby results are already implicated in their premises, but have crucially shifted towards an adaptive practice of learning from data, an inductive method of retrieving information from the environment and establishing general premises. This shift in logical methods of decision-making does not simply concern technical apparatuses, but is a symptom of a transformation in logical thinking activated with and through machines. This article discusses the pioneering work of Katherine Hayles, whose study of the cybernetic and computational infrastructures of our culture particularly clarifies this epistemological transformation of thinking in relation to machines. © The Author(s) 2019.}},

  abstract = {To maintain competitiveness as a nation, the United States must broaden participation in computing education and career pathways. Integrating computational thinking and computer science in K-12 classrooms is becoming increasingly essential to the development of a responsible and innovative workforce. Further, with increased recognition of the need for computing competency, workforce development programs that target the emerging workforce that may not be on a college pathway and those citizens who want to retool for the digital economy are also essential. This study examines work by researchers and practitioners in Mississippi to engage all public school students and the workforce with computational thinking, computer science concepts, and cybersecurity, providing pathways for learning that make computing education accessible for all citizens. The state of Mississippi has the lowest median wage in the nation, and one of the lowest rates of STEM employment. With half of the public school children identified as African American, and half of them female, there is much opportunity for broadening participation in computing. Assessments from a K-12 teacher professional development programs will be discussed, in addition to outcomes from one year of a workforce development program. © 2019 IEEE.}},

President Obama once referred to the importance of children learning programming: 'I do not want our young people to just be consumers, I want them to be producers of this technology and to understand it, to feel like they are controlling it, as opposed to it controlling them.' It is thus an increasing need for an individual to know how to write their own programs.

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is increasingly becoming a part of the K-12 educational landscape. While high schools with computer science teachers or technology coaches on staff are well positioned to help teachers integrate computational thinking into instruction, early childhood through middle schools (grades p-8) are often less well equipped. Further, the concept of CT is often poorly defined, especially as it relates to younger learners. Despite these challenges, teachers are being asked to integrate CT into other content lessons. To understand if and how this is happening, we conducted a statewide survey of primary (early childhood through middle school) Maryland teachers. The survey asked the teachers about their conceptualization of CT, CT resources they rely on, and their comfort levels to provide effective CT instruction for their students. The results of our survey demonstrate that teachers hold diverse views of the concept of CT and use a varied set of instructional resources in their classrooms. The contribution of this work is in helping advance our understanding of the current state of CT in primary classrooms. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

  abstract = {To promote computational thinking (CT) education in primary schools, in-service teachers need to attend CT teacher development programmes. One of the intended learning outcomes of the programme is to improve CT practices of teachers, which is one of the three key elements in the CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick. Assessing one's CT practices is challenging because there is no universally agreed-upon assessment method on CT practices in the existing literature. This study adopted the Evidence-centered Assessment Design (ECD) method to design test questions to evaluate teachers' development of CT practices. This study provided two Teacher Development Courses (TDCs) to enable teachers to teach CT through programming. TDC 1 focused on developing CT concepts, practices and perspectives of teachers, while TDC 2 put emphasis on pedagogies of teaching CT. 80 teachers participated in the two courses. The CT practices tests were administered before the courses, between the two courses and after the courses respectively. Results indicated that CT practices were improved progressively when the in-service teachers attended the two courses. It indicated that it is useful for teachers to experience programming practices in their initial learning as well as during their pedagogical development. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

In maker culture, the ability to program along with other technical skills often exceeds this limitation and also includes fun activities through personally fabricated projects. In this paper, we examine computational design projects that are intended to be 3D printed and could potentially introduce coding learning actions. To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features. We discuss the implications of our research for technologists, academics and teachers who wish to include 3D modeling and printing in coding learning activities. © 2019 IEEE.}},

Such calls have led to the creation of a wide variety of offerings for students at middle-school and even elementary levels, including summer “code camps” targeted at middle-school students. Such camps often emphasize fun aspects of computing, such as games and robots. In contrast, research at the collegiate level suggests that meaningful applications of computing, such as computing for social good, are more successful at building and sustaining interest, particularly among students from groups traditionally underrepresented in computing. In this project, we developed and offered a summer camp that draws upon ideas and approaches from the digital humanities (DH), which explore the use of algorithms and computation in support of broader humanistic inquiry. Because DH reveals different ways to apply algorithmic and computational thinking, DH has the potential to attract students who might not otherwise consider computing. In this paper, we introduce central issues in the digital humanities, explain the rationale for the camp design, describe the camp curriculum, and reflect on successful and less successful aspects of the camp. Among other things, we consider how to introduce digital humanities topics to students who have not yet heard the term “humanities” and explore the utility of such topics for this age group. We also present preliminary data on the short-term effects of the camp on students' self-efficacy and interest in computing. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

Learning trajectories (LTs) for computational thinking (CT) topics will help to guide emerging curriculum development efforts for computer science in elementary school.

We conducted a rigorous analysis of scholarly research on K-8 computer science education to extract what concepts in debugging students should and are capable of learning. The concepts were organized into the LT presented within. In this paper, we describe the three dimensions of debugging that emerged during the creation of the trajectory: (1) strategies for finding and fixing errors, (2) types of errors, and (3) the role of errors in problem solving. In doing so, we go beyond identification of specific debugging strategies to further articulate knowledge that would help students understand when to use those techniques and why they are successful. Finally, we illustrate how the Debugging LT has guided our efforts to develop an integrated mathematics and CT curriculum for grades 3-5. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

  abstract = {Computer Organization and Design (COD) is a fundamentally required early-stage undergraduate course in most computer science and engineering curricula. During the two sessions (lecture and project part) of one COD course, educational platforms play an important role in cultivating students computational thinking, especially the ability of viewing the hardware and software in a computer system as a whole (computer system thinking ability for short in this paper). In order to improve teaching quality, in this paper, we discuss the deployment of an inexpensive in-house Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) cloud platform, which can provide students with hardware-software co-design methodology and practice. The platform includes 32 FPGA nodes and the scale can be dynamically changed. Each cloud node is heterogeneously composed of an ARM processor and a tightly-coupled reconfigurable fabric to provide students with hands-on hardware and software programming experiences. We illustrate our efforts to make the FPGA cloud as an easy-to-use resource pool to elastically support a class with 92 undergrads via Internet access and to monitor students experimental behaviors. We also present key insights in our teaching activities that indicate such appliance is feasible to provide practice of both basic principles and emerging co-design techniques for students. We believe that our cost-effective FPGA cloud is of significant interests to educators looking forward to improving computer system-related courses. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

  abstract = {In recent years, a growing number of universities have begun to offer specialized courses as a way to make computer science (CS) more accessible to students with little or no prior CS or programming experience, especially non-CS majors. One of the ways courses have been modified for these students is by supplementing the core problem solving and coding aspects of the curriculum with explicit instruction on computational thinking principles. These “computational thinking” courses are promising in that they ground computational thinking in discipline-specific contexts and emphasize application of computational principles. However, there is little empirical research evaluating the extent to which students learn computational thinking from these courses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an online Computational Creativity course on students' computational thinking skills, creative competencies, and self-efficacy. Students in the Computational Creativity course were predominantly non-CS majors, and they completed four Computational Creativity Exercises (CCEs) that have previously been shown to improve learning and achievement. Results indicate that the Computational Creativity course was effective in increasing students' computational thinking knowledge and self-efficacy for applying computational thinking in their fields, but it did not have an impact on students' creative competencies. Additionally, students' reactions to the course and the CCEs were mostly positive. Thus, this study provides initial evidence that non-CS majors can learn computational thinking through the online Computational Creativity course. © 2019 Association of Computing Machinery.}},

One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking has become a required capability in the student learning process, and digital games as a teaching approach have presented promising educational results in the development of this competence. However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course. © 2013 IEEE.}},

The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In service to the state of the art, advances are required toward redesigning the framework over which web applications are built. The semantic web lies at the intersection of web and machine understandable meaningful data, turning it into intelligent 'web of data'. The key requirement with any intelligent system has been to find a concrete knowledge representation that can make the inferences within time and space constraints; that is, reasoning effectively and efficiently within the resource constraints posed to the problem at one hand and with insufficient data as well as incomplete knowledge on the other hand. Various Knowledge representation schemes have been proposed in the literature, each having its limitation over the others. Ontology is the key component for semantic web engineering. Ontologies are conceptual knowledge bases providing a systematic and taxonomical description of the concepts and instances under consideration. Conceptual clarity in the computational representation of a concept is vital for holistic thinking and knowledge engineering. In order to meet the needs of an application/enterprise, knowledge should be presented taking care of all possible perspectives; and represented in a hierarchical structure with differing levels of granularity. This paper discusses about bringing all the manifestations of an ontological concept/decision under one umbrella; hence describing the resultant scheme as a unit of knowledge. By representing a concept as a knowledge unit, classical ontology is claimed to be sufficient in dealing with imprecise, vague and heterogeneous knowledge for real-world web applications; and portrays the capability to acquire fresh knowledge through its thorough interaction with the external world in a given working environment. © 2019 River Publishers.}},

These frequencies also offer the potential for revolutionary applications that will be made possible by new thinking, and advances in devices, circuits, software, signal processing, and systems. This paper describes many of the technical challenges and opportunities for wireless communication and sensing applications above 100 GHz, and presents a number of promising discoveries, novel approaches, and recent results that will aid in the development and implementation of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, and beyond. This paper shows recent regulatory and standard body rulings that are anticipating wireless products and services above 100 GHz and illustrates the viability of wireless cognition, hyper-accurate position location, sensing, and imaging. This paper also presents approaches and results that show how long distance mobile communications will be supported to above 800 GHz since the antenna gains are able to overcome air-induced attenuation, and present methods that reduce the computational complexity and simplify the signal processing used in adaptive antenna arrays, by exploiting the Special Theory of Relativity to create a cone of silence in over-sampled antenna arrays that improve performance for digital phased array antennas. Also, new results that give insights into power efficient beam steering algorithms, and new propagation and partition loss models above 100 GHz are given, and promising imaging, array processing, and position location results are presented. The implementation of spatial consistency at THz frequencies, an important component of channel modeling that considers minute changes and correlations over space, is also discussed.

  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering}},
  abstract = {Programming by demonstration (PBD) transforms the robot programming from the code level to automated interface between robot and human, promoting the flexibility of robotized automation. In this paper, we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal, an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill, called MASD, is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect, gesture, and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD, the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time, driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments, the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills, and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD, the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch, verifying the initial hypothesis. Note to Practitioners - In the conventional robotized automation, the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term, with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment. On the other hand, the new trend of customization brings the new characteristics: production in short cycle and small volume. This irreversible momentum urges the robot to switch from task to task efficiently. The biggest bottleneck here is the tedious programming, which also has high prerequisites for most practitioners in manufacturing. This situation motivates the development of a PBD system that can understand the assembly skills performed by the human experts in the demonstration and accordingly generate the program for robot's execution of the taught task. In this paper, we present a skill decoding system to parse the observational raw demonstration into symbolic sequences, which is the crucial bridge to enable the automatic programming. The system achieves high performance in recognition and is tailored for the PBD in assembly tasks by considering both advantages and disadvantages in the background of assembly, such as controllable environment and limited computational resources. It is particularly useful for assembly tasks with modularized actions based on a set of standard parts. At the perspective of industrial application, the PBD upon the proposed system is a promising solution to improve the flexibility of manufacture, which is expected to be true in midterm but an important step toward this goal. © 2004-2012 IEEE.}},

Within this paper we consider a binary, a probabilistic, an opinion-space and - our recently developed approach - a weighted arithmetic mean trust model. Then we show ways, how knowledge processing systems can handle these trust values and propagate them through a network of processing steps in a way that the final results are representative.

My theory explains the difference between algorithmic thinking and computational thinking by adequately locating it in the specificities of the subject instructing a computer.

However, the issue of assessing student's learning of CT remains a challenging one: it is indeed not clear how to achieve a comprehensive evaluation that is able to assess not only the technical and domain-specific skills, but also the domain-independent meta-skills of CT. Finding a solution to this issue is crucial, because assessment not only determines whether or not educational goals are being met, but also supports the design of a curriculum. Multiple forms of assessments have been proposed within the main perspective of programming skills, neglecting the possible generalization of CT training on other skills.

Then, we discuss what non-technical skills (relational skills and cognitive life-skills) should be included in a comprehensive CT assessment framework. Moreover, we provide an indication of possible solutions to capitalize on the existing experiences in order to achieve a feasible integration of different types of assessment. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency.

  abstract = {The way in which the student processes the information, codifies it and recovers it, constitutes its learning approach. The learning process differentiates two qualitative ways of dealing with this process: the deep approach and the superficial approach. The use of each approach depends on the context. However, the adoption of a deep learning approach is positively related to the academic performance. Computational Thinking is defined as a competence of the XXI century, which allows solving problems from a computational point of view, and there is a variety of instruments that allow to measure it, and to know the state in which the evaluated student is. In this paper, we verified the existence of the positive significant relationship between the learning approach and computational thinking in students entering the career of Computer Sciences. By applying Pearson correlation test to verify the relationship between Learning Approaches and Computational Thinking, we found that both variables have homogeneous behaviors and that students show similar conditions. Men are in better conditions than women on the evaluated aspects of the Computational Thinking, Also, we found a significantly positive relationship between Computational Thinking and the Learning Approach (r = 0,882). This result shows that the learning approaches that students' practice are linked to the computational thinking they demonstrate. According to the results, the teachers of this career must develop active and deep methodological strategies due to the predisposition in these students. © 2018 ACM}},

  abstract = {As final event of the project "Informatics - A Child's Play?!", which aimed at introducing computational thinking in primary and secondary schools, the authors initiated the first Children's Congress in 2016 with the main theme of "Languages - Pictures - Information". This is now an annual event, where all participating children can slip into the role of researchers and present the results of their projects accomplished together with their teachers as well as teacher students of different master courses. As preparation the project teams get an introduction into computational thinking and several computer science concepts with the task of applying at least one of them in their project and the development of creative products. The themes of the Children's Congress are relatively open and fit into every subject, because our main aim is introducing computational thinking "by the way" to all participants. During their work on cross-curricular or even subject specific projects, pupils, students and teachers learn that basics of computational thinking are or can be integrated in every subject. This paper reports on the implementation and procedure of the Children's Congress and gives an overview of the projects accomplished in the first two years (2016 and 2017). It describes how and where computational thinking has been integrated and presents the main results of the evaluation gained from interviews and questionnaires. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

In a prior work we analyzed Likert-scaled student responses and assignment/course grades to show that not only are such assignments effective but are also largely independent of gender and prior computing experience. This paper focuses on open-ended student comments, both to see if they provide additional insights about the assignments and student perceptions not apparent from the Likert-scaled responses, and to see if these comments are consistent with the results from the prior work. We surveyed over 1000 students who had used pencil-puzzle-based assignments and invited them to make open-ended comments in their survey responses. We used grounded theory to develop codes for the large volume of student survey comments, as well as for semi-structured interviews with the instructors and focus groups with student TAs. Statistical analysis of the coded comments identified several interesting relationships, such as students being appreciative of their learning even when they perceived the assignments as difficult, which were not available from the Likert-scaled data. The analysis also confirmed that these assignments are largely gender- and experience-neutral. We conclude by discussing how these results and the coding process lead to improvements in assignment development and inform future research directions. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT), a transversal intellectual foundation integral to computer science, is making its way into compulsory comprehensive education worldwide. Students are expected to attain skills and knowledge in such interdisciplinary CT principles as Algorithmic thinking, Data representation, and Debugging. Problem-solving by designing and manipulating interactive media with Scratch, a graphical programming tool, is popular especially at the primary school level. However, there has been confusion regarding how introductory CT can be operationalized for educational practice. Teachers and students need research-based knowledge for setting appropriate learning goals in addition to instruments for formative assessment that potentially improve the quality of learning. This study contributes to these issues by developing the assessment for learning of CT via Scratch in primary school settings. A review on prior studies involving the assessment of CT-related computational ideas in Scratch has led to the conceptualization of a revised assessment framework. Next steps in the study are analyzing fourth grade students' (N=58) Scratch projects and exploring complementary methods for analyzing CT in video recordings of the students' programming processes. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

Nonetheless, the brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and 'typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based a priori knowledge about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number of training samples. © 2018 IEEE.}},

In third world countries, the situation is much more unbalanced. Poor educational and economic conditions, allied with a chauvinism culture contaminated by sexism and stereotypes, are strong forces that repel the young girls from IT areas. As a result, the percentage of women in local Computer Science majors is lower than expected.

These actions resulted in highlights achieved in programming contests and prizes obtained through application development, and have provided a more conducive academic environment to discuss issues related to the female gender in science and technology fields.

With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a 'filter' that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform.

This creates the need for a carefully planned educational approach involving different stakeholders as policymakers, educators and students. These stakeholders are the main carriers of the educational reforms thus their perspectives create various challenges and risks. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical approach of teaching coding through games and gamification of the learning process. The flipped classroom is used in order to address the shortcomings in teacher training and deliver learning outcomes in student-centred, fun and engaging way. Proposed solution includes a spiral curriculum implemented in 4 cycles that alternate cooperative and individual learning approach. The approach was evaluated with more than 199 students from 6 different schools. Evaluation analyses were focused on the achieved learning experience identifying differences between male and female students, as well as students with different level of access to IeT resources. The results confirm the benefits of the proposed solution. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The Ministry of Information Technology, Information and Communication, under the aegis of the Mauritian government aims at developing digital learning to improve the potential of Mauritian students for the future. As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop 'computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum. In the teaching area, the paper suggests that a combination of teaching programming, inclusion and informal learning will be the possibilities to accompany students overcome the digital divide and get the opportunity to become effective as learners and trained ICT students to serve their nation. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language that makes it easy for children above 10 to use. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. For this reason, educational robotics can be easily implemented thanks to the card connectors. The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution. Robotics and computational thinking are ideal tools for developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pedagogy. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. This document presents a workshop that focuses on two main objectives. The first is to make an event to promote Crumble locally. On the other hand, the aim of this event is to present a robotic teaching tool so that people can take their first steps in the world of robotics. This workshop is aimed at those children and adults who want to discover the possibilities that Crumble brings in the introduction to robotics. An introduction to Crumble in the context of educational robotics is developed throughout this workshop. © 2018 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Increasing globalization of the world leads to an emerging need for ways to analysis and understand groups from different cultures and ideologies. Researchers have used written text as a medium to examine political discourse and analyze value-motivated groups. Previous works showed that computational linguistic analysis can be performed to infer the flexibility of value-motivated groups from their writings. The main premise of these works is that text can bring insights into individuals' and groups' way of thinking, and potentially, behaviour. While existing works provide viable solutions for characterizing groups' ideological behaviour, they perform their analyses over all text published by the groups. However, researchers have found that religious and value-motivated groups can't be analyzed collectively as they regularly evolve. To address this gap, we analyze the performance of existing methods to single documents. Experimental results show that previous features (e.g., use of pronouns and judgment statements) used to predict groups' flexibility are less predictive for single documents' flexibility. We show that a newly added feature regarding the identity of a group provides a significant contribution to the prediction process. Furthermore, due to the unbalanced nature of our data, we propose a weighting scheme for linear regression based on the inter-group variance. Results indicate that a weighted least squares significantly outperforms a traditional least squares approach. This work brings new insights into the characteristics of different linguistic and performative signals, and their relationship to the linguistic flexibility of groups. It also provides a decision making support tool for practical use by practitioners. © 2018 IEEE.}},

This approach not only gives students a way to solve problems, but also ideas for what to do if they get stuck during the process. Furthermore, it provides a way for instructors to work examples in class that focus on the process of devising the code—instructors can show how to come up with the code, rather than just showing an example.

Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics. © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

For the five hypotheses tested, exploratory data analysis and nonparametric statistical testing show strong support for three of the hypotheses (cooperation is positively correlated with actors' levels of Sympathy and Trust and negatively correlated with actors' levels of Fear) and moderate support for the fourth (cooperation is negatively correlated with actors' levels of Greed). Indications are that the fifth hypothesis (cooperation is correlated with history of behavior) is not needed to explain observed behavior. Multiple correspondence analysis showed significant interactions both among pairs of forces and when a force is paired with decision making strategies.

In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data. Furthermore, we confirmed that the prediction performance of ANFIS model using CFCM clustering method is constant. © 2018 IEEE.}},

By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities. © 2018 IEEE.}},

The field of computer science education is always being challenged with the high attrition rates despite the ever growing industry demand for computing expertise. The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles. For evaluation of learning outcomes based on the quantifiable criteria with robust statistical analysis, eleven sections of the course over three semesters were considered.

As a skill, Computational Thinking should be taught in all schools, employing computational ideas integrated into other disciplines. Up until now, questions about how Computational Thinking can be effectively taught have been underexplored preventing efforts to cross the large gap between early adopters and the early majority, conceptualized as the Computer Science Education chasm. A promising strategy to cross the chasm is underway in Switzerland. Switzerland recently introduced a national curriculum, called Lehrplan 21, mandating Computer Science Education. This mandate requires the Computer Science education of elementary and middle school students. In 2017, the School of Education of Northwestern Switzerland (PH FHNW), introduced a mandatory pre-service teacher Computer Science Education course, to satisfy this mandate. All the PH FHNW students who study to become elementary school teachers must pass this two-semester course. The first part of this course was taught for the first time in fall of 2017. This paper presents the philosophy of this course and an initial analysis of both qualitative data capturing the students’ perceptions of Computational Thinking and quantitative data describing shifts in students’ skills and attitudes as effect sizes.

The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games.

  abstract = {The paper outlines some direct solution strategies for sparse matrices arising from the finite element (FE) discretization of electromagnetic (EM) models, and explores whether the conventional thinking followed by highly optimized direct method tools for sparse matrices is indeed the best available option for directly solving FEM problems in EM. Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations. © 2018 Applied Computational Electromagnetics Society (ACES).}},

This study compared the effects of using two kinds of robots- Dash & Dot and LEGO NXT, in terms of students' performance, student's attitudes about learning activities, and how different genders respond to various robots. A Quasi-Experimental Design was conducted. The participants consisted of 106 6th graders from four classes of students. Two classes were designated as the experimental groups which used Dash & Dot robots,). The other two classes of students were the control groups which used NXT robots. With respect to students' attitudes toward learning, the study showed no significant difference between experimental and control groups. With respect to learning programming skills, it was found that females in the experimental group prefer to use robots. Females showed a definite preference for using the Dash & Dot robots. © 2018 IEEE.}},

Computational thinking is a problem solving process that, at first sight, has not much to do with language learning. However, as demanded by Jeannette Wing in 2006, it should be taught to everyone like reading, writing and mathematics. By introducing computational thinking in language lessons e.g.Through modeling we could 'kill two birds with one stone': On the one hand, we can teach computational thinking and basics of computer science at all school levels even if there is no related subject, e.g. in primary schools. On the other hand, computational thinking tools like modeling can support language learning in different ways and help to train text comprehension, to acquire and elaborate vocabulary or to visualize grammar rules etc. This paper describes some creative possibilities of introducing computational thinking through modeling in language lessons in primary and secondary education.

This paper describes an adaptation of EarSketch for use in an introductory undergraduate-level programming course for non-majors at an open-access four-year college. The paper describes a quasi-experimental study comparing student engagement, content knowledge, and intention to persist between course sections using EarSketch and non-EarSketch flavors of the curriculum, along with a path analysis exploring factors related to student engagement and intention to persist. The findings suggest that STEAM learning interventions such as EarSketch can significantly impact gains in student content knowledge, engagement, and intention to persist across diverse undergraduate student populations. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).}},

We will discuss our successes and failures, and provide information on our future plans to incorporate more formalized education theory, pedagogy, and research methodology in future years to further this project. Based on our assessment results, we observed statistically significant gains in student self-efficacy with creating computer programs that perform a variety of operations. In addition, students reported a significantly higher understanding of how computer programming can be used in daily life. Our survey also highlighted differences in student self-efficacy between the two interventions, and we discuss possible sources for that result.

In our course, students develop their own research questions regarding air quality before using their own air quality sensor kit to answer their respective questions. This project combines electronics and coding with natural sciences providing a truly interdisciplinary course. We have open-sourced the teaching materials including the building and coding instructions. In addition, students can contribute to our web-based platform for storing, visualizing, and exploring the collected air quality data. It also provides an open API for anyone to download air quality data collected by the students. Through the website, available at airbit.uit.no, students are motivated to contribute air quality data open to the public. We describe lessons learned from our pilot project in a Norwegian upper secondary school and how we are deploying it in 10 schools across Northern Norway. In the pilot, students successfully built and coded the air:bits, and after two months of data collection they could correctly describe local patterns in the air quality. We believe that by combining electronics and coding with the natural sciences we motivate students to engage in all scientific disciplines. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).}},

  abstract = {As countries adopt computing education for all pupils from primary school upwards, there are challenging indicators: significant proportions of students who choose to study computing at universities fail the introductory courses, and the evidence for links between formal education outcomes and success in CS is limited. Yet, as we know, some students succeed without prior computing experience. Why is this? Some argue for an innate ability, some for motivation, some for the discrepancies between the expectations of instructors and students, and some - simply - for howprogramming is being taught. All agree that becoming proficient in computing is not easy. Our research takes a novel view on the problem and argues that some of that success is influenced by early childhood experiences outside formal education. The analysis indicates that computing proficiency should be seen from multiple viewpoints, including both skill-level and confidence. Our analysis is the first to show, we believe, that particular early childhood experiences are linked to parts of computing proficiency, namely those related to confidence with problem solving using computing technology. These are essential building blocks for more complex use. We recognize issues in the experimental design that may prevent our data showing a link between early activities and more complex computing skills, and suggest adjustments for future studies. Ultimately, we expect that this line of research will feed in to early years and primary education, and thereby improve computing education for all. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

CCEs were done in lower- and upper-division CS courses at a single university. Students in CCE implementation courses were compared to students in the same courses in different semesters. Propensity score matching was used to create comparable groups (control and implementation) based on students' GPA, motivation, and engagement. Results showed that implementing CCEs in undergraduate CS courses enhanced grades, learning of core CS knowledge, and self-efficacy for creatively applying CS knowledge. However, CCEs did not impact creative competency. The effect of the CCEs was consistent across upper- and lowerdivision courses for all outcomes.

Secondary school computer science curricula such as Exploring CS and AP CS Principles often teach the concept of variables in the context of algebra, which most students have already encountered in their mathematics courses. However, when strategizing how to introduce the concept at the middle school level, we confront the reality that many middle schoolers have not yet learned algebra. With that challenge in mind, this position paper makes a case for introducing the concept of variables in the context of middle school science. In addition to an analysis of existing curricula, the paper includes discussion of a day-long pilot study and the consequent teacher feedback that further supports the approach.

Armed with carefully prepared pedagogical datasets, computing educators can contextualize assignments and projects in societally meaningful ways, thereby benefiting students’ long-term professional careers.

Moreover, the impact of a data science context on students’ motivation remains poorly understood. To address these issues, we have created an open-sourced manual for developing pedagogical datasets (freely available at https://think.cs.vt.edu/pragmatics). Structured as a collection of patterns, this manual shares the expertise that we have gained over the last several years, collecting and curating a large collection of real-world datasets, used in a dozen of universities worldwide.

It is the first, fundamental step to an effective progression from computing with numbers to computing with numeric words with precisation of their meaning.

The platform has been designed with the aim to address both the problems detected as the educational gaps associated to the acquisition of the algorithmic thinking needed in the conceptualization and structuring of a program or algorithm determined. To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area. These aspects were needed in the design and implementation of the platform in the areas of hardware and software respectively. It is expected with this research, the design and implementation of a mobile platform related to microcontrollers' area which addresses the problems mentioned and also enhances the learning process in the students. The educational and technical validation of the platform will be developed through qualitative study between different groups of students in the subjects of the curriculum concerning the microcontrollers' area, thus, validating the impact of the platform. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {This study sheds light on a holistic understanding of muqarnas with its historical, philosophical and conceptual backgrounds on one hand and formal, structural and algorithmic principles on the other hand. The vault-like Islamic architectural element, muqarnas, is generally considered to be a non-structural decorative element. Various compositional approaches have been proposed to reveal the inner logic of these complex geometric elements. Each of these approaches uses different techniques such as measuring, unit-based decoding or three-dimensional interpretation of two-dimensional patterns. However, the reflections of the inner logic onto different contexts, such as the usage of different initial geometries, materials or performative concerns, were neglected. In this study, we offer a new schema to approach the performative aspects of muqarnas tectonics. This schema contains new sets of elements, properties and relations deriving partly from previous approaches and partly from the technique of folding. Thus, this study first reviews the previous approaches to analyse the geometric and constructional principles of muqarnas. Second, it explains the proposed scheme through a series of algorithmic form-finding experiments. In these experiments, we question whether ‘fold’, as one of the performative techniques of making three-dimensional forms, contributes to the analysis of muqarnas in both a conceptual and computational sense. We argue that encoding vault-like systems via geometric and algorithmic relations based on the logic of the ‘fold’ provides informative and intuitive feedback for form-finding, specifically in the earlier phases of design. While focusing on the performative potential of a specific fold operation, we introduced the concept of bifurcation to describe the generative characteristics of folding technique and the way of subdividing the form with respect to redistribution of the forces. Thus, in this decoding process, the bifurcated fold explains not only to demystify the formal logic of muqarnas but also to generate new forms without losing contextual conditions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.}},

The programming concepts and the fostered pedagogical environment were implemented in three-hour evening sessions over 15 weeks in which the students were encouraged to develop programming communities while working on computational thinking concept strands. The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java. Our findings provide unique insights into intervention constraints for an urban retraining program which can be used to guide and inform further retraining computer learning program research. © 2017 IEEE.}},

Because of its importance in understanding natural language semantics, it becomes one of the most challenging issues within this field. In this paper, we present an enhanced knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that manipulates by calculating the semantic similarity between definitions of the target word and an extended syntactic context vector. The actual meaning of the target word is identified as that for which the semantic similarity between definition and extended syntactic context vector is highest. Therefore, while traditional WSD approaches are based on semantic information, our method is built on both semantic and syntactic relations between sentences. This allows it to take advantage of a better use of comprehensive knowledge and more in line with the human being way of thinking. For the sake of improving the performance of WSD, we combine the syntactic importance of the words within the original document piece to provide a sequence that can be used to decide which words should be disambiguated. Finally, the evaluation performed on two standard datasets shows that our algorithm goes better beyond the baselines and has more desirable features than other popular algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.}},

In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT. © 2017 IEEE.}},

As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York.

The pragmatic thinker Dewey embraced practice in learning and argued that learning and knowing always come from experiencing the world. According to this view, there are no epistemological differences between theory and practice. In computer programming the student's active learning in the form of physical motor movement is important. Using the pragmatic way of analyzing learning to program puts a focus on the situated thinking during the practical programming, which relates to theories about CT.

  abstract = {The celebrated sparse representation model has led to remarkable results in various signal processing tasks in the last decade. However, despite its initial purpose of serving as a global prior for entire signals, it has been commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a concatenation of banded circulant matrices. While several works have presented algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very few truly-effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In this paper, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal and noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as the ℓ0 norm, mutual coherence, Spark and restricted isometry property to their counterparts in the convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local treatment. © 1991-2012 IEEE.}},

Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2017 IEEE.}},

Pedagogical research shows that project based learning encourages and supports design thinking and collaborative work; skills that are important to practitioners in data science centric industries. To address these academic needs, we develop the Evergreen Learning Platform (EvergreenLP). EvergreenLP is an interdisciplinary project based learning framework that leverages pedagogy rooted in Critical Media Literacy. Students take advantage of design-learning principles on the front-end and computational discipline standards on the back end. Students are engaged in the design, development and use of this platform while simultaneously contributing data content on the chosen social media platform. Our data analysis and visualization environment allows the student coders and non-coders to explore data science principles in context of a current event or topic trending on twitter.

Educators and researchers are using two main approaches to teach these skills in schools: with computer programming exercises, and with unplugged activities that do not require the use of digital devices or any kind of specific hardware. While the former is the mainstream approach, the latter is especially important for schools that do not have proper technology resources, Internet connections or even electrical power. However, there is a lack of investigations that prove the effectiveness of the unplugged activities in the development of computational thinking skills, particularly for primary schools. This paper, which summarizes a quasi-experiment carried out in two primary schools in Spain, tries to shed some light on this regard. The results show that students in the experimental groups, who took part in the unplugged activities, enhanced their computational thinking skills significantly more than their peers in the control groups who did not participate during the classes, proving that the unplugged approach may be effective for the development of this ability. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python. © 2017 IEEE.}},

To investigate more long-term effects of assigning versus customizing characters as well as explore perceptions of personal character appearance, we conduct a study in which sixth and seventh grade students are introduced to programming concepts with the software VEnvI (Virtual Environment Interactions) in seven one-hour sessions over two weeks. In VEnvI, students create performances for virtual characters by assembling blocks. With a between-subjects design, in which some of the students can alter their character and others are not given that possibility, we examine the influence of the presence or absence of character choice options on learning. We hypothesize that students have higher learning outcomes when they can choose and customize how their character looks compared to when they are assigned a character.

  abstract = {Many cities and countries are now striving to create intelligent transportation systems that utilize the current abundance of multisource and multiform data related to the functionality and the use of transportation infrastructure to better support human mobility, interests, and lifestyles. Such intelligent transportation systems aim to provide novel services that can enable transportation consumers and managers to be better informed and make safer and more efficient use of the infrastructure. However, the transportation domain is characterized by both complex data and complex problems, which calls for visual analytics approaches. The science of visual analytics is continuing to develop principles, methods, and tools to enable synergistic work between humans and computers through interactive visual interfaces. Such interfaces support the unique capabilities of humans (such as the flexible application of prior knowledge and experiences, creative thinking, and insight) and couple these abilities with machines' computational strengths, enabling the generation of new knowledge from large and complex data. In this paper, we describe recent developments in visual analytics that are related to the study of movement and transportation systems and discuss how visual analytics can enable and improve the intelligent transportation systems of the future. We provide a survey of literature from the visual analytics domain and organize the survey with respect to the different types of transportation data, movement and its relationship to infrastructure and behavior, and modeling and planning. We conclude with lessons learned and future directions, including social transportation, recommender systems, and policy implications. © 2000-2011 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Pedagogic Conversational Agents are interactive systems that teach by talking to the students. They have been used in several domains to develop competences such as storytelling or negotiation from University to Pre-Primary Education. However, in the literature, no cases of using agents for teaching programming to develop computational thinking in children have been found. In the last decades, there is a growing interest in developing computational thinking in children. According to some authors, if children develop computational thinking, they will be able to solve not only computer problems but their daily life problems in a better way. It is under research which educational technologies and methodologies can be more adequate depending on the context to achieve this goal. In this paper, it is proposed, for the first time, the use of Pedagogic Conversational Agents to develop computational thinking in children. Given the complexity of designing this new type of agent, and as it has been done in previous occasions when trying to design a new agent, the MEDIE methodology will be followed to eventually integrate the agent into the classrooms. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.}},

  abstract = {As K-12 computer science (CS) initiatives scale throughout the U.S., educators face increasing pressure from their school systems to provide evidence about student learning on hard-Tomeasure CS outcomes. At the same time, researchers studying curriculum implementation and student learning want reliable measures of how students apply their CS knowledge. This paper describes a two-year validation study focused on end-of-unit and cumulative assessments for Exploring Computer Science, an introductory high school CS curriculum. To develop the assessments, we applied a principled methodology called Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) to (1) work with various stakeholders to identify the important computer science skills to measure, (2) map those skills to a model of evidence that can support inferences about those skills, and (3) develop assessment tasks that elicit that evidence. Using ECD, we created assessments that measure the practices of computational thinking, in contrast to assessments that only measure CS conceptual knowledge. We iteratively developed and piloted the assessments with 941 students over two years and collected three types of validity evidence based on contemporary psychometric standards: Test content, internal structure, and student response processes. Results show that reliability was moderate to high for each of the unit assessments; the assessment tasks within each assessment are well aligned with each other and with the targeted learning goals; and average scores were in the 60 to 70 percent range. These results indicate that the assessments validly measure students' computational thinking practices covered in the introductory CS curriculum. We discuss the broader issues we faced of balancing the need to use the assessment results for evaluation and research, and demands from teachers for use in the classroom. © 2017 ACM.}},

This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS. Finally, we present several working examples based on the works of Open Source Physics at Singapore. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Drawing on the long debate about whether computer science (CS) and computational thinking skills are innate or learnable, this working group is based on the following hypothesis: The apparent innate ability of some CS learners who succeed in CS courses despite no prior exposure to computing is a manifestation of early childhood experiences and learning outside formal education. The key elements here are early experiences which are outside formal education that may be leading to success in CS courses, as these aspects have not been previously studied in detail. Example experiences and learning are the kinds of toys played with, the encouragement given to explore, particular hobbies, exposure to different kinds of languages, and so on. An informal exercise with 16 CS academics elicited the following potential pre-requisites from their own childhood experiences: • Modelling, particularly when designing from scratch • Autonomous devices from paper planes to steam engines • Exposure to ad-hoc household fixing / repair processes • Toys with discrete, not continuous, elements, e.g. Lego bricks, not smooth wooden blocks • Interest in notations - music, languages (bi-lingual parents) • Parental attitudes encouraging open exploration, with minimal limits and permission to fail • Following instructions: knitting, cooking, origami, Lego • Making games - a set of rules Consideration of the hypothesis leads to the following research questions: 1. Can we find activities that are relatively more common to the childhood experiences of those with CS skills, e.g. successful CS students, academics and professionals, by comparison with other members of the population? 2. If such activities can be determined, what common understanding, skills or attitudes can be derived from them? 3. Can the common aspects of the activities be linked to CS skills and therefore seen as pre-requisites? 4. In what ways are these common aspects already present in formal early years or primary education, and where they are not, how could they be incorporated effectively? Studies supporting this hypothesis would be beneficial as follows: • Provide further evidence against the innate view of CS skills, encouraging study of CS specific pedagogy. • Inform educational practices and research in the early years, a field recognised as being of increasing importance. • Enable early years and primary teachers with no formal CS background to focus on educational activities with which they are familiar and confident while still developing essential foundations for CT skills. The primary focus of this working group is the first research question above. If this is answered positively, then we will work on preliminary answers to the subsequent questions. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).}},

Relying on the concept of articulation developed in cultural studies, the article asks what, exactly, is meant by the computational in the context of journalism? Drawing on interviews with key managerial staff, editors and developers at Scandinavian news organizations, three broad claims about the linkage between the computational and journalism emerged. These articulations include the notion that machines don’t have instincts, that democracy can never be personalized and finally that the computational is something to think with, rather than simulate. The argument is made that what can and cannot be calculated is not merely a technical question, it is also a deeply social, cultural, political and economic one. Thus, the computational emerges as an important organising framework and discursive order for thinking and talking about journalism in the digital age. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.}},

Once an anathema to parents and teachers, digital games are increasingly at the forefront of conversations about ways to address student engagement and provoke challenges to media pedagogies. While advances in game-based learning are already transforming educative practices globally, with tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google taking notice and investing in educational game initiatives, there is a concurrent and critically important development that focuses on “game construction” pedagogy as a vehicle for bringing computational literacy to middle and high school students. Founded on Seymour Papert’s constructionist learning model and developed over nearly two decades, there is compelling evidence that game construction can increase confidence and build capacity in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. This project is a research-based challenge to the by now widely questioned but surprisingly persistent presumption that students in today's classrooms are all by default “digitally native” and that those “digitally native” children are learning just by playing digital games. Through a survey of 60+ students at a largely immigrant middle school in Toronto, Canada, we present some important updates on youth’s media and technology competence and its relationship to baseline knowledge of computer programming and performance in a computational literacy game-based curriculum. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.}},

  abstract = {In knowledge-based societies new generations are flooded more and more intensely with narratives of inherited and newly generated knowledge, which is simply accessible for these generations, or to be acquired by them. Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Currently, there is a "boom" in introductory programming courses to help students develop their computational thinking skills. Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: A) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices; b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors; and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-Aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. These snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. Submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. We leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. Also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. We have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. Our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings. © 2017 IEEE.}},

The results clearly indicate that the students selected this major on their own, based on their previous experiences in informatics, but that these experiences caused misconceptions rather than creating a true picture of the nature of computer sciences. Based on the analysis of the students' answers, we concluded that they are in great need of institutional support, especially at the beginning of their tertiary studies, to introduce them to computer sciences/informatics. Beyond this, we have revealed another misconception that Software Engineering students tend to focus on the coding aspect of informatics, and especially those who have taken the advanced level school leaving exam are over-confident as regards their programming skills. © 2017 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, 'moderately ill-structured problems' are defined as a category of problems specified by 'well-structured domain model' and 'ill-structured problem setting'. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as 'problem-posing assignment' based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback. © 2017 IEEE.}},

In addition to the common quizzes, we developed various we-based interactive exercises to enable the learners to experiment and interact directly with the presented concepts. Furthermore, we implemented programming exercises with constructive feedback for the learners using a web-based integrated development environment and additionally an automatic grading system. The target group of the course are prospective students of science or engineering that are due to attend CS lessons in their first terms. The course was conducted as a prototype with a limited number of participants. In a concluding survey, the participants submitted textual feedback on the course; some of them proposed specific improvements for the employed interactive exercises.

We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency. © 2017 IEEE.}},

Most parents, policy makers, teachers, and industrial stakeholders want their children to attain computational thinking and coding competences, since learning how to code is emerging as an important skill for the 21st century. Currently, educators are leveraging a variety of technological tools and programming environments, which can provide challenging and dynamic coding experiences. Despite the growing research on the design of coding experiences for children, it is still difficult to say how children of different ages learn to code, and to cite differences in their task-based behaviour. This study uses eye-tracking data from 44 children (here divided into "kids" [age 8-12] and "teens" [age 13-17]) to understand the learning process of coding in a deeper way, and the role of gaze in the learning gain and the different age groups. The results show that kids are more interested in the appearance of the characters, while teens exhibit more hypothesis-testing behaviour in relation to the code. In terms of collaboration, teens spent more time overall performing the task than did kids (higher similarity gaze). Our results suggest that eye-tracking data can successfully reveal how children of different ages learn to code. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).}},

This paper lays out the practical and theoretical motivations for the Computational Thinking for Girls (CT4G) project, specifically highlighting the use of Making through physical and social computing as ways to engage students in CS. A snapshot of one activity from the program is provided - Wearing the Web - in which students use open-hardware programmable badges to explore the underlying structure and technology that enables the Internet. Data from the first year of the CT4G program are presented to show the positive effects that this diverse introduction to CS is having on the students with respect to their attitudes toward CS. © 2016 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Over the past five years, there has been a major push to develop the computational thinking skills of K-12 students. Tools such as Scratch, Alice, and Kodu have been developed to engage students in learning to program through the creation of computational artifacts (e.g., games, animations, and stories). However, less is known about how elementary and middle school children reason about program behavior. Such skills are useful for reading and adapting others programs, locating possible sources of bugs, and predicting program behavior given code snippets (i.e., mental-simulation). The goal of this poster is to measure and track the development of students' ability to reason about programs using Teague & Lister's Neo-Piagetian classification of novice programmers: Sensorimotor, Preoperational Thinkers, and Concrete Operational Thinkers. We operationalize Teague and Lister's category descriptions by creating a criterion for each category. This classification has helped us characterize students' mastery of strategies for reasoning about the lawful behavior of programs using a Kodu curriculum. In particular, this categorization was used to differentiate students' reasoning styles using data from two studies having 20 and 19 students each. We found strong consistency in the results across both studies. Through analysis and categorization of student responses, most students fall into the preoperational thinker category. Within this category, we found a diversity of mastery patterns that help us understand where students face challenges in reasoning about programs. © 2017 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Computer programming is being introduced in schools worldwide as part of a movement that promotes Computational Thinking (CT) skills among young learners. In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners-even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning-still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations. © 2017 IEEE.}},

We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general.

This integrated STEM experience helped a team of researchers that included students from K-12, undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to collaboratively understand, design and test potential solutions to the problem. The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries.

The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding.

The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials.

Alongside the growing volumes of information collected about human behavior through transactions, communications, and web searches, the Internet of Things promises to supply digital information to help us monitor machines and improve our everyday interactions with new devices. The temptation to construct evermore complex models is widespread, driven by the appearance of increased sophistication and the hope of improving predictability. The philosophical principle known as Occam's razor, however, warns against complexity and favors parsimonious models. When attempting to quantify risk, this guiding principle is as relevant today as it was when introduced in the 14th century. Transparency and ease of use are also important characteristics of models that will appeal to practitioners. Rather than seeking the holy grail of the illusive single optimal model, an ensemble of diverse parsimonious models may offer the best chance of accurately quantifying risk. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Embedded computing is often considered as a hidden technology where learners can require more assistance to inspect processes and activities hidden within the technologies, making use of debugging, monitoring, and visual tools. To the student, this kind of technology often has abstract behaviours where the only information/things people can see is the final action, and they do not know how the internal processes work and communicate inside the embedded computing device to achieve the desired result. Augmented reality (AR) can overcome this issue and produce a magic-lens view for revealing hidden embedded computing activities. This can result in learners achieving a better level of knowledge and awareness of the technology, as well as higher learning outcomes. AR on its own will not improve the learning processes without first considering how to manage and represent the hidden information. Therefore, a pedagogical virtual machine (PVM) model was employed, and to evaluate the learning effectiveness of the proposed model. We conducted an experiment based on a problem-solving educational mobile robot task. Twenty students participated in the experimental (AR approach) and control (conventional approach) group. The result showed that the augmented reality approach was more effective in increasing students' computational thinking and learning outcomes. In addition, the augmented reality approach reduced both time completion and debugging times. © 2017 ACM.}},

Based on the social trends, various web services for the education of programming which improves the computational thinking of a student. Among the web services, block-based programming languages are well known as an effective educational tool for a primary student though a freshman in the university. These tools are proven to be useful tools since the tools provide same programming environment to the students and the teachers anytime and anywhere. However, the environments may be insufficient for learning practical programming languages, such as C/C++ and Java, because they are not the block-based programming languages. This paper introduces a block-based learning environment for C programming language using web services. The environment fills the gap between building computational thinking and learning the syntax of the programming language. The programming environment provides the equivalent environment to teachers and the students during the programming hands-on. © 2016 IEEE.}},

  journal = {Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning}},
  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) parallels the core practices of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and is believed to effectively support students’ learning of science and math concepts. However, despite the synergies between CT and STEM education, integrating the two to support synergistic learning remains an important challenge. Relatively, little is known about how a student’s conceptual understanding develops in such learning environments and the difficulties they face when learning with such integrated curricula. In this paper, we present a research study with CTSiM (Computational Thinking in Simulation and Modeling)—computational thinking-based learning environment for K-12 science, where students build and simulate computational models to study and gain an understanding of science processes. We investigate a set of core challenges (both computational and science domain related) that middle school students face when working with CTSiM, how these challenges evolve across different modeling activities, and the kinds of support provided by human observers that help students overcome these challenges. We identify four broad categories and 14 subcategories of challenges and show that the human-provided scaffolds help reduce the number of challenges students face over time. Finally, we discuss our plans to modify the CTSiM interfaces and embed scaffolding tools into CTSiM to help students overcome their various programming, modeling, and science-related challenges and thus gain a deeper understanding of the science concepts. © 2016, The Author(s).}},

We propose a difficulty factors assessment (DFA) to explore two factors that may make learning to identify fallacies more difficult: type of instruction and belief bias. This study will allow us to make two key contributions. First, we will better understand the relationship between sense-making and induction when learning to identify informal fallacies. Second, we will contribute to the limited work examining the impact of belief bias on informal (rather than formal) reasoning.

  abstract = {Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet. © 2016 IEEE.}},

Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents. © 2016 IEEE.}},

Bebras tasks engender the development of computational thinking skills by incorporating abstraction, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, evaluation and generalization. Bebras tasks cover a range of informatics concepts including algorithms and data structures, programming, networking, databases and social and ethical issues. Having built up a substantial number of Bebras tasks over 12 years it is important to be able to categorize them so that they can be easily accessed by the Bebras community and teachers within schools. The categorization of tasks within Bebras is important as it ensures that tasks span a wide range of topics; there have been several categorization schemes suggested to date. In this paper we present a new two-dimensional categorization system that takes account of computational thinking skills as well as content knowledge.

  abstract = {Background: Robotics competitions are increasingly popular and potentially provide an on-ramp to computer science, which is currently highly gender imbalanced. However, within competitive robotics teams, student participation in programming is not universal. This study gathered surveys from over 500 elementary, middle, and high school robotics competition participants to examine (1) whether programming involvement in these competitions is associated with motivation to pursue additional programming experiences and (2) whether opportunities to learn programming varied by gender, age, and competition type. Results: Results showed a significant association of students’ programming involvement with their motivation to learn more programming. Interestingly, in the youngest groups/entry-level competitions, girls were heavily involved in programming. Unfortunately, in older/more advanced competitions, girls were generally less involved in programming, even after controlling for prior programming experience. These gendered effects were substantially explained by programming interest. Conclusions: While robotics competition experiences may motivate students to learn more programming, gender gaps in programming involvement persist in these learning environments and appear to widen as students grow older and enter more advanced competitions. Therefore, addressing gender imbalances in programming will likely require greater attention to particular curricular and pedagogical characteristics of robotics competitions that support girls’ interest and involvement in programming. © 2016, The Author(s).}},

These teaching modules include a lecture module, an online test module and a CFD project module. The lecture module introduces the importance of critical thinking skills by an example case, critical thinking definition and processes, and the application of critical thinking skills in formulation of CFD problems. In the online test module, seven online tests have been developed to enhance the students' understanding of the contents of lectures and practical sessions. Meanwhile, students apply their critical thinking skills to work out some of the tests. In the project module, a student-driven CFD project is designed to help students to apply CFD techniques and critical thinking skills in engineering problems. In the project, students choose their own project topic and problems. They use CFD skills learned in the course and critical thinking skills to critically analyse their problems, identify the important parameters and review results. They apply the critical writing skills to finalise a project report. To the best knowledge of the author, this systematical integration of teaching and enhancement of critical thinking skills in computational fluid dynamics course is innovative.

  abstract = {In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system, is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered.

  abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) is beginning to be accepted as one of the fundamental 21st century skills for everyone. Curricula and environments are being developed for different group ages, from kindergarten to university, in several countries. As part of this global tendency, France has recently taken political decisions to integrate CT Education (CTE) in the mandatory national curriculum. However, many challenges remain until a full implementation is achieved. In this paper we report on a partnership between a university, local elementary schools and the county Ministry of Education (MoE), and on an exploratory project of introducing CT to K-5 students. This project has provided us with valuable feedback on the specifics of integrating CT in a national curriculum and the creation of a partnership and a community. These lessons will be used in the following stage of scaling up to more elementary schools in the entire county, but also addressing other school levels such as kindergarten, middle school and high school.}},

  journal = {Communications of the ACM}},
  abstract = {IN AUGUST 2015, Professor John H. Holland passed away in Ann Arbor, MI, where he had served on the University of Michigan faculty for more than 50 years. John, as he was known universally to his colleagues and students, leaves behind a long legacy of intellectual achievements. As a descendant of the cybernetics era, he was influenced by the work of John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, W. Ross Ashby, and Alan Turing, all of whom viewed computation as a broad, interdisciplinary enterprise. Holland thus became an early proponent of interdisciplinary approaches to computer science and an active evangelist of what is now called computational thinking, reaching out enthusiastically to psychologists, economists, physicists, linguists, philosophers, and pretty much anyone he came in contact with. As a result, even though he received what was arguably one of the world's first computer science Ph.D. degrees in 1959,23 his contributions are sometimes better known outside computer science than within. Holland is best known for his invention of genetic algorithms (GAs), a family of search and optimization methods inspired by biological evolution. Since their invention in the 1960s, GAs have inspired many related methods and led to the thriving field of evolutionary computation, with widespread scientific and commercial applications. Although the mechanisms and applications of GAs are well known, they were only one offshoot of Holland's broader motivation-to develop a general theory of adaptation in complex systems. Here, we consider this larger framework, sketching the recurring themes that were central to Holland's theory of adaptive systems: discovery and dynamics in adaptive search; internal models and prediction; exploratory modeling; and universal properties of complex adaptive systems.}},

Our objective is to understand how people learn computational thinking concepts while creating mobile applications with App Inventor. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between the progression of skill in using App Inventor functionality and in using computational thinking concepts as learners create more apps. We model skill progression along two dimensions: breadth and depth of capability. Given a sample of 10,571 random users who have each created at least 20 apps, we analyze the relationship between demonstrating domain-specific skills by using App Inventor functionality and generalizable skills by using computational thinking concepts. Our findings indicate that domain-specific and generalizable skills progress similarly; there is a common pattern of expanding breadth of capability by using new skills over the first 10 projects, then developing depth of capability by using previously introduced skills to build more sophisticated apps. © 2016 IEEE.}},

Recent studies conducted in the US have shown that not only do high school students lack any exposure, but also they possess ill-conceived notions of what computer science is, a problem also affecting their parents, teachers and regional school superintendents. For incoming students, the extent to which computing technology impacts their daily lives is very likely at odds with the extent to which they have considered how software works and its ethical implications. The ability to critically analyze and consider related ethical consequences of computing is an important life skill for every twenty-first century adult and not just computer scientists. With this this in mind, this paper presents a unique CS0 introduction to programming and computer ethics for pre CS and non majors. It has been defined as a service course to promote digital literacy and to ensure that students appreciate what computer science is and its socio-ethical implications.

  abstract = {Although mutation analysis is considered the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite, hefty computational cost often limits its use. To address this problem, various mutation reduction strategies have been proposed, all seeking to reduce the number of mutants while maintaining the representativeness of an exhaustive mutation analysis. While research has focused on the reduction achieved, the effectiveness of these strategies in selecting representative mutants, and the limits in doing so have not been investigated, either theoretically or empirically. We investigate the practical limits to the effectiveness of mutation reduction strategies, and provide a simple theoretical framework for thinking about the absolute limits. Our results show that the limit in improvement of effectiveness over random sampling for real-world open source programs is a mean of only 13.078%. Interestingly, there is no limit to the improvement that can be made by addition of new mutation operators. Given that this is the maximum that can be achieved with perfect advance knowledge of mutation kills, what can be practically achieved may be much worse. We conclude that more effort should be focused on enhancing mutations than removing operators in the name of selective mutation for questionable benefit. © 2016 ACM.}},

Results revealed that graphical input could keep children focused on problem solving better than tangible input, but it was less provocative for class discussion. Tangible output supported better schema construction and casual reasoning and promoted more active class engagement than graphical output but offered less affordance for analogical comparison among problems.

Interdisciplinary computing collaborations have become a popular mode of instruction in upper-level CS courses. In many cases, these collaborations have been with other STEM disciplines. However, there are non-STEM fields that have been transformed by computer science and can also serve as fruitful test beds for curricular innovation; journalism is one such field. In this study, undergraduate students in CS and journalism courses focused on creating a computational solution to address a real community need. The study investigates whether immersion in multidisciplinary collaborative experiences increases the computational thinking abilities of both CS and non-CS students. 41 CS students participated in the study alongside 96 students in a range of other STEM and non-STEM majors. Quantitative data were collected to gauge students' attainment of concepts and skills constitutive to computational thinking. Pre-test data indicate that CS students were no different from other STEM students in their own assessment of computational thinking and skills. Post-test data indicate that while all students made significant gains in self-assessment of skills and knowledge, CS majors fared significantly better than their peers. It is particularly noteworthy that CS majors' gains outpaced those of computer engineering majors.

Inferences from fusion must then account for uncertainties about the model, the credibility of information, and the fusion methods-i.e. We must consider both structural and parametric uncertainties, including uncertainties about the uncertainties. We use a novel combination of (1) probabilistic and parametric methods, (2) alternative models and model structures, and (3) alternative fusion methods that include nonlinear algebraic combination, variants of Bayesian inference, and a new entropy-maximizing approach.

The workshop introduced the participants to CT concepts and demonstrated how CT strategies of pattern recognition, generalization, problem decomposition and algorithmic thinking can be used to improve student learning of STEM concepts. The proposed special session will present sample CT modules and projects and lesson plans designed by participants during the workshop. It will include interactive, hands-on activities and discussions in addition to results from the teachers' actual experiences on applying these lesson plans in their classes. This special session will benefit K12 teachers of STEM subjects interested in improving their students' comprehension of discipline related concepts and their application. Moreover computer science faculty interested in helping K-12 teachers by organizing training sessions will gain valuable insights from the first-hand accounts of the presenters of their own experience with such an effort. © 2016 ACM.}},

  abstract = {While pedagogical and technological affordances of three-dimensional (3D) multiuser virtual worlds in various educational disciplines are largely well-known, a study about their effect on high school students' engagement in introductory programming courses is still lacking. This case study presents students' opinions about their participation in a 3D multiuser game-like environment, by harnessing Second Life in combination with the two-dimensional (2D) programming environment of Scratch4SL. Following a blended instructional format (face-to-face in a computer laboratory and supplementary online courses), 56 students utilizing Scratch4SL participated in this study, with a view to reduce the "steep learning curve" created during their first-time entrance into Second Life. This study identifies Papert's theory of Constructionism as a potentially appropriate theoretical foundation for the development of an instructional framework, in order to assist students to coordinate and manage learning materials with other teammates, using their computational thinking skills in collaborative problem-based programming tasks. The study findings based on a mixed-method research (a close-ended questionnaire and an open-ended interview) indicated the effectiveness of this "constructionist-oriented" instructional process for students' engagement to acquire or empower social, cognitive, higher-order, and computational thinking skills.

Hence, we designed CS0 by selecting some of the best components of other CS0 efforts from the literature, namely, introductory programming in Python, computational thinking, and motivational material aimed at instilling ownership of the major. In order to direct students into CS0 or CS1 appropriately, a placement exam was given to students during orientation. The placement process resulted in a mixed cohort consisting of students with no programming experience as well as other students with programming experience who did not pass the placement exam. Longitudinal analysis of student grades in CS0 and CS1 showed that these were two distinct populations with very different needs. A statistically significant difference was found in the CS1 grades for CS0 students from these populations. Surprisingly, CS0 students without prior programming experience got significantly higher grades in CS1 than CS0 students who had programmed before. We share lessons learned from our experience, including a revised placement process to address these separate populations. © 2016 ACM.}},

There are several tools implemented for text-based plagiarism detection using various methods and techniques. However, these tools become inefficient while handling a large number of datasets due to the process of plagiarism detection which comprises of a lot of computational tasks and large memory requirement. Therefore, when we deal with a large number of datasets, there should be a way to accelerate the process by applying acceleration techniques to optimize the plagiarism detection. In response to this, we have developed a parallel algorithm using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and tested it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. An equivalent algorithm is run on CPU platform as well. From the comparison of the results, CPU shows better performance when the number and the size of the documents are small. Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU.

  year = {2016}},
  journal = {Neuroscience in the 21st Century: From Basic to Clinical, Second Edition}},
  abstract = {Philosophers, psychologists, and biologists have long pondered how experiences mark the mind. It is clear that there is no one seat of memory. Within each memory system there are multiple biological mechanisms for information storage. This chapter focuses on how memory could be supported by coincidence of neural activity, changes in synaptic strength, and synchronization of networks. Another major theme in memory research is the localization and specialization of function by different memory systems which can be revealed through appropriate behavioral tests. Recent technological advances allow for powerful new ways to record and perturb neural circuits to test the veracity of long-held theories about the relationship between biology and cognition. The fundamental challenge for a memory system is to recognize past experiences that have utility in guiding action. This is difficult because no two situations are identical, and therefore it is necessary for the brain to match which events and stimuli should be grouped together due to common meaning. This is the computation that occurs upon meeting someone new and thinking, “You remind me of an old friend." From this flash of familiarity, recollections of past experiences shape the interaction with the stranger and, in doing so, bias how this new person is seen and which aspects of the experience become committed to memory. This everyday example illustrates the profound influence memory has on learning, behavior, and even perception. There are several ways to seek an explanation for how the brain uses the past to bias future behavior. One is to design experiments that decrease the probability of an event’s occurrence, such as removing a part of the brain and observing memory loss. These loss-of-function experiments elucidate the necessity of a specific phenomenon for the occurrence of another. Other experiments are designed to cause something to happen, such as the delivery of a drug that enhances memory performance. These experiments inform us as to the sufficiency that the presence of one event is enough to observe another. Gain of function and loss of function experiments may perturb the system in unexpected ways, and therefore it is also important to observe the brain with minimal intervention. In such observations, experimenters seek to identify variables that covary, such as the activity of a neuron correlating with some stimulus. A final and important method for understanding the link between biology and cognition is computational and mathematical modeling of neural systems (Hopfield 1995; Marr 1971). These more abstract analyses can offer predictions that, if validated, lead credence to the model from which the prediction was derived, which may provide insight into processes beyond the current limit of experimental validation. Furthermore, there may be many biologic solutions to the same computational problem and modeling efforts help to identify necessary and sufficient overarching principles that unite seemingly disparate observations. The convergence of these lines of evidence - necessity, sufficiency, correlation, and modeling - has shown that there are multiple memory systems that specialize in storing and processing different kinds of information. In each of these systems, information is thought to be stored in changes in communication efficacy between neurons. The temporal organization of neural activity required for such changes in synaptic strength and for efficient communication is achieved by coordination of brain rhythms across brain regions. This chapter will handle these broad topics with an emphasis on the technological advances in behavioral testing, genetics, imaging, and recording that allowed each new scientific advance. Very few contemporary concepts in memory research are brand new, and therefore it is essential to first discuss the insights of the pioneers that have shaped the current understanding of the neurobiology of memory © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2013 and Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.}},

  abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill for students, and assessment is a critical factor in education. However, there is a lack of effective approaches to CT assessment. Therefore, we designed the Three-Dimensional Integrated Assessment (TDIA) framework in this article. The TDIA has two aims: one was to integrate three dimensions (directionality, openness, and process) into the design of effective assessment tasks; and the other was to assess comprehensively the three dimensions of CT including computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Guided by the TDIA framework, we designed three pairs of tasks: closed forward tasks and closed reverse tasks, semiopen forward tasks and semiopen reverse tasks, and open tasks with a creative design report and open tasks without a creative design report. To further confirm each task's applicability and its advantages and disadvantages, we conducted a test experiment at the end of the autumn semester in 2014 in a primary school for 3 weeks. The results indicated that (a) the reverse tasks were not more superior than the forward tasks; (b) the semiopen tasks and the open tasks were more effective than the closed tasks, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others; (c) the self-reports provided a helpful function for learning diagnosis and guidance; (d) the scores had no significant difference between the schoolboys and the schoolgirls in all six tasks; and (e) the six tasks' difficulty and discrimination were all acceptable, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others. To effectively apply them, the following suggestions for teachers to design computational tasks are proposed: motivating students' interest and enthusiasm, incorporating semifinished artifacts, involving learning diagnosis and guidance, and including multiple types of tasks in an assessment. © The Author(s) 2015.}},

  abstract = {Introduction to Computing is a public course for the first-year non-major undergraduate students, aiming at training students for the abilities in computer science and technology with computational thinking. However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing. © 2015 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Background: Problem posing, the generation of questions by learners, has been shown to be an effective instructional strategy for teaching–learning of complex materials in domains such as mathematics. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of problem posing in two dimensions. Firstly, we present how problem posing can result in unfolding of knowledge and hence how it can be used as an instructional strategy. Then we present another problem posing-based activity as an assessment tool in an Introductory Programming course (CS1). Method: To explore the potential of problem posing as an instructional strategy, we conducted field studies in the two CS application courses (Data Structures (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)), in which we provided a semi-structured problem posing situation to students. We performed inductive qualitative research and development the questions generated by students using grounded theory-based qualitative data analysis technique. To explore the potential of problem posing as an assessment tool, we conducted a field study in CS1 wherein we employed another problem posing (PP)-based activity in a large class for assessing the learning of computational thinking concepts in an introductory programming course and analysed how performance in traditional assessment tools (quiz score) is related with performance in our non-traditional assessment tool (quality of problems posed during a problem posing activity). Results: From the studies in DS and AI courses we found that students pose questions and unfold knowledge using seven strategies — Apply, Organize, Probe, Compare, Connect, Vary, and Implement. From the field study performed in the CS1 course we found that the quality of the problems posed (difficulty level) were mostly aligned to the traditional assessment results in the case of novice learners but not in the case of advanced learners. © 2015, The Author(s).}},

Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations. Our hope is that utilization of CT characteristics and principles will become more commonplace in public education, be utilized more continuously through primary and secondary grades, and be inventively applied across a more inclusive range of academic disciplines. © 2015 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {For all computer scientists the term 'modeling' is well known. It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project 'Informatics - A Child's Play', which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons. © 2015 IEEE.}},

Based on the model, the teachers can teach the problem-solving process by using computer more intuitively and clearly and the students can understand the application of computer knowledge more easily and simply.

  journal = {Proceedings of the IEEE}},
  abstract = {In this era of large-scale data, distributed systems built on top of clusters of commodity hardware provide cheap and reliable storage and scalable processing of massive data. With cheap storage, instead of storing only currently relevant data, it is common to store as much data as possible, hoping that its value can be extracted later. In this way, exabytes (10 $^{18} $ bytes) of data are being created on a daily basis. Extracting value from these data, however, requires scalable implementations of advanced analytical algorithms beyond simple data processing, e.g., statistical regression methods, linear algebra, and optimization algorithms. Most such traditional methods are designed to minimize floating-point operations, which is the dominant cost of in-memory computation on a single machine. In parallel and distributed environments, however, load balancing and communication, including disk and network input/output (I/O) , can easily dominate computation. These factors greatly increase the complexity of algorithm design and challenge traditional ways of thinking about the design of parallel and distributed algorithms. Here, we review recent work on developing and implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and distributed environments. Randomized algorithms for matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either in theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a single machine. Our main focus is on the underlying theory and practical implementation of random projection and random sampling algorithms for very large very overdetermined (i.e., overconstrained) $\ell-{1}$- and $\ell-{2} $-regression problems. Randomization can be used in one of two related ways: either to construct subsampled problems that can be solved, exactly or approximately, with traditional numerical methods; or to construct preconditioned versions of the original full problem that are easier to solve with traditional iterative algorithms. Theoretical results demonstrate that in near input-sparsity time and with only a few passes through the data one can obtain very strong relative-error approximate solutions, with high probability. Empirical results highlight the importance of various tradeoffs (e.g., between the time to construct an embedding and the conditioning quality of the embedding, between the relative importance of computation versus communication, etc.) and demonstrate that $\ell-{1}$- and $\ell-{2} $-regression problems can be solved to low, medium, or high precision in existing distributed systems on up to terabyte-sized data. © 1963-2012 IEEE.}},

Nevertheless, the execution of computer programs usually takes place on a traditional desktop computer, which has a limited repertoire of input and output interfaces to engage with the user. On the other hand, pedagogy has emphasized that physical representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning to code for ubiquitous computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for the desktop computer. For this purpose, thirty-six students participated in a within groups study that involved three types of tangibility at the target computer platform: 1) desktop with Scratch, 2) wearable with Arduino LilyPad, and 3) robotic with Lego Mindstorms. Regardless of the target platform, we employed the same desktop visual programming environment (MIT Scratch, Modkit and Enchanting) and we measured emotional engagement and assessed students' programming skills. We found that students expressed more positive emotions while programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms didn't affect dramatically students' performance in computational thinking. © 2015 ACM.}},

In earlier phases of the intervention, male students outpaced their female peers in learning gains. However, female students caught up during a multi-week classroom implementation.

This paper reports on the design and evaluation of a domainspecific programming language, POP-PL, for expressing medical algorithms. The design draws on the experience of researchers in two disciplines, programming languages and medicine. The language is based around the idea that programs and humans have complementary strengths, that when combined can make for safer, more accurate performance of prescriptions. We implemented a prototype of our language and evaluated its design by writing prescriptions in the new language and administering a usability survey to medical professionals. This formative evaluation suggests that medical prescriptions can be conveyed by a programming language's mode of expression and provides useful information for refining the language. Analysis of the survey results suggests that medical professionals can understand and correctly modify programs in POP-PL.}},

  abstract = {In the Western classical tradition, musicians play music from notated sheet music, called a score. When playing music from a score, a musician translates its visual symbols into sequences of instrument-specific physical motions. Hence, a music score's overall complexity represents a sum of the cognitive and mechanical acuity required for its performance. For a given instrument, different notes, intervals, articulations, dynamics, key signatures, and tempo represent dissimilar levels of difficulty, which vary depending on the performer's proficiency. Individual musicians embrace this tenet, but may disagree about the degrees of difficulty. This paper introduces musiplectics (musiplectics = music + plectics, Greek for the study of complexity), a systematic and objective approach to computational assessment of the complexity of a music score for any instrument. Musiplectics defines computing paradigms for automatically and accurately calculating the complexity of playing a music score on a given instrument. The core concept codifies a two-phase process. First, music experts rank the relative difficulty of individual musical components (e.g., notes, intervals, dynamics, etc.) for different playing proficiencies and instruments. Second, a computing engine automatically applies this ranking to music scores and calculates their respective complexity. As a proof of concept of musiplectics, we present an automated, Web-based application called Musical Complexity Scoring (MCS) for music educators and performers. Musiplectics can engender the creation of practical computing tools for objective and expeditious assessment of a music score's suitability for the abilities of intended performers. © 2015 ACM.}},

  abstract = {Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of 'layers of abstraction' guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints. © 1988-2012 IEEE.}},

A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus 'i' is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well. © 2015 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Unlike enrollment in undergraduate computer science degree programs, there are no gender or ethnic imbalances in K-12 enrollment. While such disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app. © 2015 IEEE.}},

To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success. These results have also implied that the assessment of Computational Thinking can be used as an early intervention tool to improve the students' retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM related disciplines. © 2015 IEEE.}},

This paper examines teacher practices that are intended to promote CT skill acquisition through instruction that takes place in two framing contexts. The phenomenological context, which is based on observable patterns of object interaction that recur in games and simulations, is particularly valuable for developing the capacity to think abstractly. Abstraction is the key to recognizing analogous conditions, an ability that is the basis for transferring learning to new situations. The disciplinary context describes areas of application within and across subject areas, including computer science, that can foster proficiency with data representation, problem decomposition, and other CT skills. Using the Scalable Game Design curriculum as a lens to examine classroom practices, we find that teachers both plan and enact CT instruction in these contexts.}},

The research questions focus on understanding which is the best medium to design algorithms by comparing flow chart and the Scratch programming language and by evaluating whether using textual language is worth the effort of the syntactic burden imposed by these languages. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that both a visual programming and a flow-chart approach are suitable for algorithm design with no statistical difference in terms of number of errors and time taken to write the corresponding code in a textual language.

For two words to be compared, we first retrieve their related concepts; then produce lowest common ancestor matrix and distance matrix between concepts; finally calculate distance-based similarity and information-based similarity, which are integrated to get final semantic similarity. The main contribution of our method is that both concept occurrence frequency and word's sense number are taken into account.

The majority of fourth grade students from one school demonstrated the ability to synchronize the costume and motion of a single character sprite, as well as synchronize a basic conversation between multiple sprites. However, they struggled to integrate motion and costume changes into a multi-sprite conversation. The majority of fourth grade students from the second school, where reading and math comprehension scores fall below the state minimum requirements for proficiency, were unable to demonstrate a basic understanding of the programming tasks. The results suggest that fourth grade students who read at grade level are capable of understanding the relationships between multiple concerns within a single script, along with synchronizing a single concern across multiple scripts, but are challenged when synchronizing multiple concerns across multiple scripts.

This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects.

In this regard, this paper summarizes the work done in the school San Diego and San Vicente (Madrid, Spain) during the third quarter of the year 2013/2014, where we conducted a study with four groups of students in 4th and 5th grade to measure to what extent the use of computer programming in English classes can be an interesting educational tool with a positive impact on the learning otucome of the students. The results show that the groups working with programming activities improved more than the groups using traditional resources. Moreover, when asked via surveys at the end of the study, most students felt that coding was a positive influence, not only for learning English, but for developing other important skills as teamwork and learning to learn. © 2015 IEEE.}},

In this sense, research studies that analyse the causes of the reduction of students who are interested in computer science mainly point to young people being unaware of the type of tasks computer scientists perform. Therefore, in order to try to reverse this trend many types of initiatives have been organized seeking to bring the world of computing to children and adolescents. In the same vein, the main objective of the Europe Code Week, an initiative which was held in parallel in 38 countries and in which more than 100,000 people participated, is to show the beauty and fun associated with programming as a means of attracting young people to computer science to get endow the European labour market with well-trained professionals who are required in this field.

  abstract = {An important task in engineering is the numerical design of structures. The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive ("wait-And-see") and active ("here-And-now") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps. Efficient approximate metamodels are, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks, and Extreme Learning Machines. The applicability of approach are demonstrated by means of engineering examples. © 2015 IEEE.}},

For many students the subject of computer science concerns software code but writing code can be challenging, due to specific requirements on syntax and spelling with new ways of thinking required. Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly 'computational thinking', to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements. First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment. Finally, we look at an ongoing after school robotics club where participants face a number of challenges of their own making as they design and create a variety of robots using a number of common tools such as Scratch and Arduino. © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The complexity of medical problem solving presents a formidable challenge to current theories of cognition. Building on earlier work, we claim that the systemslevel cognitive model LIDA (for 'Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent') offers a number of specific advantages for modeling diagnostic thinking. The LIDA Model employs a consciousness mechanism in an iterative cognitive cycle of understanding, attention, and action, endowing it with the ability to integrate multiple sensory modalities into flexible, dynamic, multimodal representations according to strategies that support specific task demands. These representations enable diverse, asynchronous cognitive processes to be dynamically activated according to rapidly changing contexts, much like in biological cognition. The recent completion of the LIDA Framework, a software API supporting the domain-independent LIDA Model, allows the construction of domain-specific agents that test the Model and/or enhance traditional machine learning algorithms with human-style problem solving. Medical Agent X (MAX) is a medical diagnosis agent under development using the LIDA Model and Framework. We review LIDA's approach to exploring cognition, assert its appropriateness for problem solving in complex domains such as diagnosis, and outline the design of an initial implementation for MAX. © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The age of ubiquitous/pervasive/ambient computing is upon us. We see more and more connected objects and devices embedded in everyday life. Design and Human-Computer Interaction are crucial components of information technologies that color our experience. As designers and technologists, we have the unique opportunity to imagine, design and create interesting, intelligent and interactive technologies for a smart living environment. A smart living environment is responsive, reconfigurable and transformable, embedded with sensors and actuators, to support everyday happy, healthy living with things that think, spaces that sense and places that play. Specifically, we see opportunity for investigating creative design computing to consider the built environment as an interface. We aim to engage people in playful, creative ways in which computing technologies embedded in the built environment (e.g., objects, furniture, building, and space) can support everyday happy healthy living. We build wellness technologies in different scales (e.g., in human-centered view: hand, body and environment), for various applications (e.g., to support emotional, physical, and intellectual wellness) to unlock human potential and augmenting human capabilities through digital design innovations. Opportunities exist for integrating multidisciplinary perspectives together to create innovation with impacts. For example, the Mobile Music Touch, a light-weight fingerless instrumented glove provides passive haptic learning of piano playing but also works as an effective rehabilitation tool. The ClockMe system, not only converts traditional pencil-and-paper Clock Drawing Test on a digital tablet for automatic scoring and analysis for detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders but also provides more information of the drawing behavior such as drawing sequence and pressure. The Digital Box and Block Test employs image processing to automatically detect and record a clinically validated post-stroke rehabilitation assessment for in-home use and a tangible gaming system to increase patient motivation. The Dodo game provides pictures of cute animals for color matching, and serves as a clinical screening test to detect color deficiency in young children. The Taste + bottle and spoon provide stimulation to alter the sense of taste without any chemical flavoring using electric pluses and color LED lights. It could encourage water drinking or enhance taste for people with restrictive diets or diminished taste sensations. The Sensorendipity is a real-time smartphonebased web-enabled sensor platform for designers to create sensor-based applications such as monitoring activities, in exergaming or safe driving. Now is an exciting time to engage in creative design computing, to implement physically and computationally enhanced environment, to explore experience media, to build prototypes, towards a smart living environment. Advancing technology offers new ways to solve problems, discover opportunities, and create new objects and experience that delight our senses and improve the way we live and work. Let's begin with the spark of creativity and enthusiasm and follow up with design and computational thinking towards the goal of creating unique technology for everyone.}},

  abstract = {Undergraduate traditional instructional delivery that does not utilize computation is linked significantly to students' low performance and thereby attrition. Over the last two decades, new computational technologies, information, and communication have emerged, creating comprehensive cyberinfrastructurebased service systems, or what is termed here e-science. E-science environments are virtual systems that support data management, data mining, information acquisition, visualization, computing services, and people collaboration over the Web. Although a number of attempts have been successful in utilizing escience environments to change how research is conducted, using e-science environments for education has been rarely realized. This chapter describes a project that aims to transform Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education through using e-science systems at the undergraduate level. The strategy is built on three arms: (1) injecting Computational Thinking (CT) in STEM education; (2) using e-science for STEM learning; and (3) building a community-of-practice around e-science. By using e-science resources and services, an inquiry-based approach to learning can be the key to students' motivations, achievements, and enthusiasm for science. © 2014 by IGI Global.

Our focus is on computational thinking (CT), a term meant to encompass a set of concepts and thought processes that aid in formulating problems and their solutions in different fields in a way that could involve computers [130]. The main goal of this report is to help teachers, those involved in teacher education, and decision makers to make informed decisions about how and when CT can be included in their local institutions. We begin by defining CT and then discuss the current state of CT in K-9 education in multiple countries in Europe as well as the United States. Since many students are exposed to CT outside of school, we also discuss the current state of informal educational initiatives in the same set of countries. An important contribution of the report is a survey distributed to K-9 teachers, aiming at revealing to what extent different aspects of CT are already part of teachers' classroom practice and how this is done. The survey data suggest that some teachers are already involved in activities that have strong potential for introducing some aspects of CT. In addition to the examples given by teachers participating in the survey, we present some additional sample activities and lesson plans for working with aspects of CT in different subjects. We also discuss ways in which teacher training can be coordinated as well as the issue of repositories. We conclude with future directions for research in CT at school. Copyright © 2014 ACM.}},

The development of Computer Science (CS) is historically related to Mathematics; however, CS is said to have singular reasoning mechanics for problem solving, whose applications go beyond the frontiers of Computing itself. These problem-solving skills have been defined as Computational Thinking skills. In this chapter, the possible relationships between Math and Computational Thinking skills are discussed in the perspective of national curriculum guidelines for Mathematics of Brazil, Chile, and United States.

To augment these previous role allocation approaches, this article presents a modification to the skill, rule, and knowledge-based behavior taxonomy that includes expertise and uncertainty. Skill-based behaviors are the best candidates for automation, assuming significant sensor performance assumptions can be met, but rule and knowledge-based reasoning are better suited for human-computer collaboration. Such systems should be designed so that humans harness the raw computational and search power of computers for state-space reduction, but also allow them the latitude to apply their expertise in uncertain situations through inductive reasoning for potentially creative, out-of-the-box thinking. © 2001-2011 IEEE.}},

First year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. There were four different types of answers: The student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution.

  abstract = {From an engineering point-of-view, cognitive control is inspired by the prefrontal cortex of the human brain; cognitive control may therefore be viewed as the overarching function of a cognitive dynamic system. In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional Q-learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning. © 2014 IEEE.}},

Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards 'learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the 'power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts. In doing so, this research aims to make a paradigm shift in the 'approach to teaching and learning programming.' © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {As computer science plays an increasingly large role in our lives, it is important to also move it into our classrooms. Computer science careers are among the fastest growing jobs, yet large groups of the population are severely underrepresented in computer science. Elementary school is a key time to introduce computer science or computational thinking because students are capable of programming and they will soon be deciding whether they see a future in the sciences. Including computational thinking as a part of the elementary school general education would give all children an introduction to the subject. In addition, elementary schools are looking for computational thinking material. We need appropriate, research-based tools and curricula for them to use. Unlike the natural sciences, computer science's domain is pliable. Through language and programming environments, developers can create new ways to represent computational thinking concepts. My research seeks 1) to understand how 4th through 6th grade students learn computational thinking, 2) to develop computational thinking learning progressions and curricula, and 3) to create a language and programming environment suitable for elementary school classes and teachers who do not have a computer science background.

Thus in our previous two texture techniques mentioned before, GLCM and variance, metrics such as variance would be selected for comparison purposes as they require less computational time.

  abstract = {Embodied interaction concerns the way that user senses the environment, acquires information, and exhibits intention by means of physical action. In a complex decision making scenario, which requires maintaining high level of attention continuously and deep understanding about the task and its context, the use of embodied interaction has the potential to promote thinking and learning. Creating a framework that allows decision makers to interact with information using the whole body in intuitive ways may offer cognitive advantages and greater efficiency. This paper proposes such a computational framework based on a Bayesian approach (coined BAN) to infer operators' focus of attention based on the operators' physical expressions. Then, utility theory is adopted in order to determine the best combinations of interaction modalities and feedback. Experiments involving five physical interaction modalities (touchless, glove-based, and step gestures, speech, and body balance) and two feedback modalities (visual and sound) were conducted to assess the proposed framework's performance. This also includes the likelihood of assessed attention from enhanced BANs and task performance as a function of the interaction and control modalities. Results show that physical expressions have a determining factor in the quality of the solutions in spationavigational type of problems. © 2014 IEEE.}},

In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear "dosage" effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 - 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 =.127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 =.106.

  journal = {Proceedings - 2014 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Computing and Engineering, LATICE 2014}},
  abstract = {Some complex problems in the computational area are learning programming and algorithms. Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as 'processes or outcomes' [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire: -There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Win steps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test: -The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs: -Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning. © 2014 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The existing trends and growing tendency to high-performance computing strongly require traditional computational algorithms to be revised in such a way that would permit optimal hardware implementations to be found. The latter can be done if algorithms can efficiently be mapped to hardware-specific functional blocks that require different style of thinking and manipulation by different operations and memory models. Besides, concurrency (pipelining and parallelism) can be widely applied. This paper focuses on data processing algorithms that use values of incoming data items as memory addresses with one-bit flags indicating presence or absence of data. The main problem of similar known methods is an appearance of huge number of memory cells with no data items (empty holes), which, nevertheless, have to be processed involving lots of unnecessary time. It is proposed to apply N-ary tree technique that enables data items to be stored and found very fast through executing special traversal procedure. Such trees completely differ from known tree-walk tables because they have pre-established configuration that does not require explicit addresses of subsequent (child) nodes. As a result the size of memory needed to keep data items is decreased in number of times. Finally, significantly more complicated problems can be solved faster and with smaller hardware resources. The presented results of numerous experiments clearly demonstrate advantages of the proposed method compared to known implementations. © 2013 IEEE.}},

Referencing Epstein's Generativity Theory, we designed and deployed a suite of creative thinking exercises with linkages to concepts in computer science and computational thinking, with the premise that students can leverage their creative thinking skills to "unlock" their understanding of computational thinking. In this paper, we focus on our study on differential impacts of the exercises on different student populations. For all students there was a linear "dosage effect" where completion of each additional exercise increased retention of course content. The impacts on course grades, however, were more nuanced. CS majors had a consistent increase for each exercise, while non-majors benefited more from completing at least three exercises. It was also important for freshmen to complete all four exercises.

The guiding research question for this study was: How teachers implement the backwards design process embodying elements of CS Principles (i.e., computational thinking big ideas and computational thinking practices) in the context of their classrooms? The participants of this study included 15 elementary, high school and college level teachers who are also graduate students from a master program in engineering. As part of the workshop participants developed a learning activity that included a set of learning objectives, the design of computational thinking related activities considering appropriate pedagogical strategies, and the integration of mechanisms to evaluate students' performance. Here we describe (a) how participants embodied the CS Principles in the design of learning activities to be integrated into their classrooms, (b) how they used the backwards design process as a tool to implement elements of the CS Principles and (c) what is teachers' performance in integrating CS Principles to the design of learning activities as evidenced by their peer evaluations. Finally, we propose the use of backwards design process together with the CS Principles as a framework for the design of computing learning activities and the development of teacher professional development programs in computing education. © 2013 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Programming skills are an important component of an engineering curriculum, not only because they enable the customization of software tools to be used in the profession, but also (and perhaps more crucially) because of the «computational thinking» and problem solving capabilities that are ideally developed by young students who learn to program for the first time. The necessity to expand the computing curriculum across a wider range of schools and university courses for students who are not majoring in Computer Science (CS) ) it is well-documented in literature [1], as is the difficulty of teaching 21st century skills (www.p21.org. This work presents an educational approach to teaching initial programming based on the development of fundamental and transversal skills and computer science skills, including creative and computational thinking as well as problem solving and critical thinking. The approach is based on cutting-edge educational tools, namely the visual programming frameworks Scratch, AppInventor, BYOB, and the well-known C/C++ language; curriculum material is drawn from CSPrinciples pilot courses, CS unplugged, school level preparation material for the International Olympiad in Informatics, and are complemented by supplementary information. The pedagogical approaches used in the course are based on constructivist learning theory, experiential learning and guided inquiry. This paper presents a year-long teaching experience in a 10th/13th grade high school with 14 to 16-year-old students. Ways to extend the experience to a university course are also presented. An initial analysis of the course results, both qualitative (based on two student surveys) and quantitative (based on formal written examinations) is presented and discussed. Results are encouraging, showing how visual programming languages help students to improve their problems solving skills and reasoning practices. Exposing the younger generation to computational concepts is fundamental in order to improve the mastering of these concepts and increase the success rate in university studies. © 2014 IEEE.}},

Drawing on extensive empirical data, this article provides a conceptual overview of the field by identifying three main pathways of computational exploration in journalism: the newsroom approach, the academic approach, and the entrepreneurial approach. Implications for changing journalistic practice are discussed, and the theorizing is summed up in a triplex proposition about changing mindset processes coming out of CEJ.

The current research furthers knowledge of CTPA by exploring its validity based on how its performance correlates to human grading of student games. Initial data from this validation study indicates that CTPA correlates well with human grading and that it can even be used to predict students' future achievement levels given their current skill progression, making CTPA a potentially invaluable computational thinking evaluation tool for teachers.

Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of parameter selections.

  journal = {Exploring Multimodal Composition and Digital Writing}},
  abstract = {By utilizing digital tools that are nearly ubiquitous in the lives of youth, writing teachers can leverage these practices for developing traditional English language arts instruction and skills proposed by state and federal standards. In this chapter, the authors propose how the development of computational literacies through multimodal writing and video game design can help guide critical and academic development in an inner-city Los Angeles public school. In a research project where high school youth designed and created (programmed) a video game about an issue significant in their lives, students demonstrated their critical computational literacies, a concept that blends the critical consciousness of critical literacy and the skills and concepts behind computational thinking. Critical computational literacy offers the ability to integrate two seemingly divergent fields. By using these new media tools, students developed a more expansive and sophisticated way to communicate their ideas. This has significant possibilities for the English Language Arts, where most K-12 state standards still relegate students' literacies to overindulgence of traditional means of reading and writing of text. In an ever-evolving culture that increasingly places more significance on visual, auditory, and textual stimuli through multimodal media on computers and mobile devices (Hull & Nelson, 2005; Jenkins, 2006; Kress, 2010), schools must educate students to critically "read" messages in the media, and in turn become effective producers of these tools of communication (Alvermann, et al., 1999; Margolis, 2008; Morrell, 2008). This research shows students engaged in deep, reflective processes in the production of their multimodal texts. © 2014 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.}},

This paper proposes using music theory with the information from music charts in the evaluation criterion to address this issue. Specifically, we generate the weighted rules based on music theory for the fitness function. The weights are determined according to the download numbers from music charts.

Moreover, educational programming has always been one of the key components of this subject. In this paper, we report on one of our on-going research activities in the area of building and integrating our conception of educational programming into regular primary Informatics. Namely, we present the process and findings of a qualitative study, in which we develop and verify a new approach to designing programming tasks for primary students. We want to understand what cognitive demands these tasks pose to primary students, what the students consider difficult and what they consider easy - we are in search of better pedagogy for the primary programming education. To meet these goals, we need to identify elementary cognitive operations in primary programming and on the basis of that learn how to be more competent in considering the level of difficulty of the programming tasks and how to design proper gradational sequences (gradations) of tasks, which will support smooth learning process of the primary students' programming skills and early computational thinking - carefully respecting developmental appropriateness of these activities.

These two dilemmas are related, in that computer science can be used to teach many of the 21st century skills, and bringing computer science to all K-12 students can help broaden participation. For computer scientists, key 21st century skills [4] include creativity & innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, communication & collaboration, information literacy, media literacy and information, communications and technology (ICT) literacy-these skills go beyond traditional "computational thinking" skills because they include reflections on how computation affects social processes (such as the role of computational media in society). Since 2009, K-12 educators and computer science graduate students in the Engaging Computer Science in Traditional Education (ECSITE, pronounced "excite") project have developed curricular units that are embedded into non-computing K-12 classes [3]. These units collectively address many 21st century skills, and have been introduced into arts, geography, government, health, music, and science classes. Copyright © 2013 ACM.}},

  abstract = {The term computational thinking has received some discussion in the field of computer science education research. The term is defined as the concept of thinking about problems in a way that can be implemented in a computing device. Of course, after having thought about a problem using computational thinking skills, the next step should be to use programming skills to implement the solution. This work in progress is exploring ways in which programming can be employed as a tool to teach computational thinking and problem solving. Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals from various industries. They are purposively selected because of their knowledge of or interest in the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, and the teaching of programming. This data is analyzed within the paradigm of the grounded theory approach. The results of an initial analysis imply an ordering of complexity associated with computational thinking skills, imply connections between computational thinking skills and programming activities, and imply a relationship between computational thinking skills and other taxonomies of learning.

Loosely-coupled associative computing techniques, which have so far not been considered, can provide the break-through needed for a distributed data management scheme. Using a novel lightweight associative memory algorithm known as Edge Detecting Hierarchical Graph Neuron (Edge HGN), data retrieval/processing can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem, conducted across multiple records within a single-cycle, utilizing a parallel approach. The proposed model envisions a distributed data management scheme for large-scale data processing and database updating that is capable of providing scalable real-time recognition and processing with high accuracy while being able to maintain low computational cost in its function. © 2012 IEEE.}},

In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results. © 2012 IEEE.}},

Despite the clear realization of the immense power of chemical strategies in biology and medicine, the discovery of effective small molecule modulators for a particular biological target or phenotype remains a daunting challenge. While “omics” studies have revealed an expansive landscape of various biological systems and disease models, only a limited number of defined, biologically active compounds are available for functional exploration and for therapeutic discovery. Meanwhile, an expanding research area that uses information from genomes to develop chemical modulators for biology and therapeutics is rapidly developing due to major advances in chemistry, biology, and genomics, coupled with laboratory automation and computational technologies. This new field, chemical genomics, holds promise for transforming biological research and medicine using the power of chemistry. The book Chemical Genomics offers a collection of insightful contributions from international experts in the field and aims to further the study of chemical genomics. It covers a range of essential topics, including the basic principles of chemical biology and chemical genomics (Section One: Overviews), the fundamentals of chemical libraries (Section Two: Molecules for Chemical Genomics), the essentials of high-throughput screening and high-content screening (Section Three: Basics of High-Throughput Screening), and the design of innovative biochemical, cellular, and organismal bioassays and computational screening approaches (Section Four: Chemical Genomics Assays and Screens). The final section (Section Five: Chemical Genomics and Medicine) includes chapters that link chemical genomics with the movement toward personalized medicine and the druggable genome of the future. In selected chapters, a resource section is presented for further information. My hope is that this book provides an introduction to the principles of chemical genomics; serves as a resource for the associated technologies; and gives readers general concepts, useful vocabulary, practical techniques, and broad, forward-thinking perspectives. © Cambridge University Press 2012.}},

Magic is one of the most colorful examples of "unplugged" (i.e., without-computer, active learning) activities. It adds a unique facet in that it holds a hidden secret that an audience can be challenged to unfold. Once solved, students are often enthusiastic to perform the magic in front of others. In this session, we will share a variety of magic tricks whose answer is grounded in computer science: modulo arithmetic, permutations, algorithms, binary encoding, probability, etc. For each trick, we will have an interactive discussion of its underlying computing fundamentals, and tips for successful showmanship. Audience participation will be critical, for helping us perform the magic, discussing the solution, and contributing other magic tricks. © 2012 Authors.}},

  abstract = {A fundamental challenge to computer science education is the difficulty of broadening participation of women and underserved communities. The idea of game design and game programming as an activity to introduce children at an early age to computational thinking in a motivational way is quickly gaining momentum. A pedagogical approach called Project First has allowed the Scalable Game Design project to reach a large group of middle schools students including a large percentage of female (45%) and underrepresented (48%) students. With over 4000 students in inner city, remote rural, and Native American communities Scalable Game Design has investigated the impact on students' interest level of pedagogical approaches employed by teachers such as mediation and scaffolding. Findings suggest strong gender effects based on classroom scaffolding approaches. For instance, girls are substantially less likely to be motivated through scaffolding based on direct instruction. Conversely, guided discovery scaffolding approaches are highly motivating to the point where they can even overcome other negative predictors such as small girls to boys class participation ratios. This paper introduces the project, discusses different scaffolding approaches and presents data connecting gender specific motivational levels with scaffolding approaches. © 2012 ACM.}},

Further, students' spatial abilities are an important prerequisite to technological literacy within virtual environments. In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities teaching a large group of first-year, interdisciplinary students to apply spatial thinking skills by undertaking a team-based, design project using an industrial-strength computational design environment (SolidWorks). We describe key instructional principles and techniques used to minimize the complexity of this computational tool, thus enabling students to focus on the tasks and reasoning requirements of the design project. While encouraged by the high degree of students' motivation for building functioning animated mechanical toys (AMTs), students frequently reported being lost in SolidWorks (SW) during the modeling phases of the project. Our techniques for scaffolding learning activities have continued to evolve to minimize the challenges faced by novice users of SW and to better support them in developing their spatial thinking skills. We also present our experiences, lessons learned, and ideas for improving the design of the project, and learning activities, such as worked examples of an AMT model, to further reduce the cognitive load and to enable students to focus on visual-spatial reasoning rather than on the tacit skills associated with using SolidWorks. © 2012 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In the global context, the population of cities and urbanized areas has developed from a minority to become the majority. Now cities are the largest, most complex and most dynamic man-made systems. They are vibrant centres of cultural life and engines that drive local and global economies. Yet, contemporary urbanized areas are environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable entities laying increasing pressure on the surrounding rural areas. Traditional methods of planning and managing large cities that lead to this situation have reached their limits. The planning and design processes therefore need a radical re-thinking. On the computational side, this necessitates the integration of new methods and instruments. On the planning and design side, this requires the involvement of stakeholders and decision makers much earlier than normally done in the past. The combination of interactive design and computation will demonstrate the effects and side effects of urban-rural planning or re-development. We build our design research approach on dynamics and scale: viewing cities and settlements as entities with dynamic urban metabolisms, we propose to apply stocks and flows simulations to the building scale (small, S-Scale), to the urban scale (medium, M-Scale), and to the territorial scale (large, L-Scale). Our long-term goal is the sustainable urban-rural system. Planning and implementation examples from Switzerland and ETH Zurich Science City serve as test cases, with the intent to use the findings for developments in other parts of the world. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}},

  abstract = {Recursive reasoning of the form what do I think that you think that I think (and so on) arises often while acting in multiagent settings. Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way. While we do not claim the cognitive plausibility of the models in the absence of more evidence, they represent promising steps toward understanding and computationally simulating strategic human behavior. © 2012 IEEE.}},

NEO is designed to investigate systems we describe as complex adaptive hierarchical networks (CAHNs - complex systems represented as networks that route and store multiple interactive currencies). Models built atop NEO, are organized collections of individual values (model variables) and algorithms (model logic). Modelers systematically combine algorithms to create alternative model formulations at runtime.

Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture.

This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms.

The second part encourages them to learn to use these design principles and apply them to solving of problems requiring computational thinking [2] within the design of games centered on STEM subjects using Microsoft Kodu, a Microsoft 3D game creation tool. Globaloria is a learning environment designed for middle school classrooms where students learn STEM concepts in the process of learning to design computer games using the Adobe Flash platform. Globaloria classrooms are designed around constructionist pedagogies, and feature a project-based curriculum supported by a framework of Web 2.0 technologies, and an online community of school classrooms, educators, and professional game designers. Using multimodal content and discourse analysis, the study examined the evolution of students' STEM learning and literacy in these two contexts, as a function of their changes in language use, design strategies, and game artifact production. Findings suggest that scaffolded game design can provide an effective context for students to develop deep understandings and engagement with STEM subjects, in forms valued within the 21st century workplace.

By comparing the results (learning progressions), some obvious and some not so obvious indications emerged.

This comparison between middle school students and college students demonstrated that middle school students?' learning progressions are slower than college level students (obvious), but middle school students?' learning skill scores reached/surpassed the entry level scores of students in the college class after designing only two or more games. Consequently, these results tell us that this measurement tool although not validated yet, could measure accumulated learning in certain contexts.

However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges.

From a computational intelligence perspective, a holon can be conceived as a goal-oriented community of lower-level holons led by more specific targets. Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of holonic granule as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems. Prospective applications of holonic granule-based software models are then commented with particular emphasis to industrial automation and environmental monitoring settings. © 2011 IEEE.}},

As David Hemmendinger said in a thought piece that appeared recently in ACM Inroads: "Teaching computational thinking [to students in disciplines other than computer science]⋯ is to teach them how to think like an economist, a physicist, an artist, and to understand how to use computation to solve their problems, to create, and to discover new questions that can be fruitfully explored." [1]. As a consequence of this way to think about a proper role for computational thinking, what is emerging is a new discipline, computational science, that brings to bear the knowledge and tools of mathematics, statistics and computer science to solve problems in the sciences and engineering. This multidisciplinary approach is also leading to the creation of new scientific knowledge. In the past few years computational science programs, both at the undergraduate and the graduate level, have been springing up at a number of colleges and universities. This panel is designed to explore this relatively new phenomenon. Each of the panelists has been a leader at her/his institution in the development of such programs.

Consequently, taking into account the traffic characteristics becomes of crucial importance for performance analysis and optimization of the communication infrastructure, as well as proper resource management. Although queuing-based approaches have been traditionally used for performance analysis purposes, they cannot properly account for many of the traffic characteristics (e.g., non-stationarity, self-similarity) that are crucial for multicore platform design. To overcome these limitations, we propose a statistical physics inspired approach to capture the traffic dynamics in multicore systems. As shown later in this paper, this is of fundamental significance for re-thinking the very basis of multicore systems design; it also opens up new research directions into NoC optimization which require accurate models of time-dependent and space-dependent traffic behavior. © 2006 IEEE.}},

Thinking in large, it should be apparent that modeling social systems allowing to study crowd behavior emerging from individual entities' (agents') condition and/or characteristics is, in fact, a challenging task. To address the heterogeneity, analytical agent-based models (ABMs) are gaining popularity due to its capability of directly representing individual entities and their interactions, unfortunately, ABMs (in which each agent has unique behavior) are not very well suited for large populations, expressed by exponentially rising simulation time. To solve this problem, the questions (i) how does the parallel execution of such models scale with capabilities of both the machine (number of cores, cluster size, etc.) and agents (behavioral adaptation function, interaction extent, etc.) and (ii) what is, in comparison, the performance coefficient applying the approach of model execution on graphical processors (GPUs) with its different pipelining architecture, need answers.

  abstract = {The workshop has become a regular campus event, with both high school teachers and university faculty looking forward to it and thinking about what should be included in the workshop agenda. The future teachers enjoy attending the workshop, and feel the chance to meet working teachers is an added benefit, as ideas about curriculum design, classroom projects, and the use of Web sites in lessons can be discussed and valuable feedback received. Current computer science and information technology majors enjoy volunteering at the event and answering questions about their own preparation prior to university and their experience once on campus. This has served to personalize the 'computer science student' to the high school teachers in such a way that they can share with their students, when they return to their high school, what a computer science major really works on and how he or she got to that point. We strongly advocate universities and colleges hosting one-day high school teacher workshops. By doing so, we've been able to update and enhance many of the ideas current high school faculty have regarding applications of computers in the sciences and the utility of computational thinking in high school. Additionally, by including future teachers currently obtaining their certification, a new generation of teachers is provided with demonstrations, lessons, and applications of technology that can be used in the classroom to engage students in computational thinking and excite a new generation of computer scientists. While the multiday workshop model is outstanding, many teachers cannot spare the time to attend, or are geographically remote from such offerings. The one-day model, offered annually or bi-annually with a rotating curriculum, offers professional development and community building to regional high-school math, science, and computer science teachers which is vital to the encouragement of future generations of students. The effectiveness of the workshop in the high school community is rated highly as increasing awareness of opportunities in computing and information technology at the local university. Teachers are now suggesting to their students that they consider majoring in computer science or information technology and consider the local university. With firsthand knowledge of the faculty, resources, and facilities, this recommendation is of the highest order. A tracking project to identify students recruited to the major through their teacher's workshop experience is under way. Future plans include continuing with the teacher workshops, and hosting students nominated by teachers who attend the workshops during a summer academy for computational thinking and computer science. Teachers from the workshops held during the academic year will apply to be teaching fellows at the summer academy, during which time they will gain experience in using the demonstrations and modeling tools discussed and illustrated at the workshop with the students attending the summer academy, providing further expertise for the teachers before they return to their own high school classrooms to put into practice what they have seen. © 2011 ACM.}},

The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills.

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this is to add both to the development of complex systems thinking in the subject area of operations and production management and to the limited number of applications of computational models and simulations from the science of complex systems. The latter potentially offer helpful decision-support tools for operations and production managers. Design/methodology/approach: A mechanical engineering firm was used as a case study where a combined qualitative and quantitative methodological approach was employed to extract the required data from four senior managers. Company performance measures as well as firm technologies, practices and policies, and their relation and interaction with one another, were elicited. The data were subjected to an evolutionary complex systems (ECS) model resulting in a series of simulations. Findings: The findings highlighted the effects of the diversity in management decision making on the firm's evolutionary trajectory. The CEO appeared to have the most balanced view of the firm, closely followed by the marketing and research and development managers. The manufacturing manager's responses led to the most extreme evolutionary trajectory where the integrity of the entire firm came into question particularly when considering how employees were utilised. Research limitations/implications: By drawing directly from the opinions and views of managers, rather than from logical "if-then" rules and averaged mathematical representations of agents that characterise agent-based and other self-organisational models, this work builds on previous applications by capturing a micro-level description of diversity that has been problematical both in theory and application. Practical implications: This approach can be used as a decision-support tool for operations and other managers providing a forum with which to explore: the strengths, weaknesses and consequences of different decision-making capacities within the firm; the introduction of new manufacturing technologies, practices and policies; and the different evolutionary trajectories that a firm can take. Originality/value: With the inclusion of "micro-diversity", ECS modelling moves beyond the self-organisational models that populate the literature but has not as yet produced a great many practical simulation results. This work is a step in that direction. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.}},

In this model, Sample Problems, which are related problems, will be used like the experience of human about practical problem, simulate the way of human thinking, and give the good solution for the practical problem faster and more effectively. This extension model is applied to construct an automatic system for solving algebraic problems in middle school.}},

  abstract = {Cognitive Science appeared about 40 years ago, subsequent to the challenge of the Artificial Intelligence, as common territory for several scientific disciplines such as: IT, mathematics, psychology, neurology, philosophy, sociology, and linguistics. The new born science was justified by the complexity of the problems related to the human knowledge on one hand, and on the other by the fact that none of the above mentioned sciences could explain alone the mental phenomena. Based on the data supplied by the experimental sciences such as psychology or neurology, models of the human mind operation are built in the cognition science. These models are implemented in computer programs and/or electronic circuits (specific to the artificial intelligence) - cognitive systems - whose competences and performances are compared to the human ones, leading to the psychology and neurology data reinterpretation, respectively to the construction of new models. During these processes if psychology provides the experimental basis, philosophy and mathematics provides the abstraction level utterly necessary for the intermission of the mentioned sciences. The ongoing general problematic of the cognitive approach provides two important types of approach: the computational one, starting from the idea that the mental phenomenon can be reduced to 1 and 0 type calculus operations, and the connection one that considers the thinking products as being a result of the interaction between all the composing (included) systems. In the field of psychology measurements in the computational register use classical inquiries and psychometrical tests, generally based on calculus methods. Deeming things from both sides that are representing the cognitive science, we can notice a gap in psychological product measurement possibilities, regarded from the connectionist perspective, that requires the unitary understanding of the quality - quantity whole. In such approach measurement by calculus proves to be inefficient. Our researches, deployed for longer than 20 years, lead to the conclusion that measuring by forms properly fits to the connectionism laws and principles.}},

However, it is at a disadvantage with regard to the expression of a function, since physical phenomena, which are the essence of a function, are better expressed in the form of mathematical equations than natural languages. In this study, we attempt to develop a method for using natural language for operating a function by harnessing its advantages and overcoming its disadvantage.

One reason for this is that non-major courses are seen as potentially increasing both interest and enrollment in computer science courses. Another reason is the rising popularity of "computational thinking." Furthermore, as computation becomes the cornerstone of research methodologies, if not professional practice, in the natural, physical and social sciences, including, as well, a growing influence in the humanities, the demand from external departments/programs for non-major level service courses has began to rise, albeit slowly. This raises some interesting questions to the CSE community. Given that one offers a single non-major level course, what should be the topics covered as distinct from the technologies used to convey those topics? What learning outcomes are most desired? Finally, the competency, or at least serious introduction of which technological skills, if any, should be considered mandatory (e.g. programming). In short, what should a non-major/minor student who takes one course in computer science come away with knowing and being able to do? Possibly orthogonal to this is the question: What should any liberally (college) educated person know about computation at this point in time? This panel will outline four different perspectives on this important question in addition to engaging the audience in a discussion regarding the answers to the questions raised.}},

Moreover, current methods and tools are often ill-equipped at accommodating evolving knowledge sources and expertdriven exploration that is being enabled by computational thinking. In this paper, we discuss ongoing research that seeks to transform decades-old decision-making paradigms rooted in operations research by considering how to effectively convert data into knowledge that enhances decision-making and leads to better designs. Specifically, we address decision-making within the area of trade space exploration by conducting human-computer interaction studies using multi-dimensional data visualization software that we have been developing. We first discuss a Pilot Study that was conducted to gain insight into expected differences between novice and expert decisionmakers using a small test group. We then present the results of two Preliminary Experiments designed to gain insight into procedural differences in how novices and experts use multidimensional data visualization and exploration tools and to measure their ability to use these tools effectively when solving an engineering design problem.

If that model is material it is a simple simulation, if it is abstract it is a reflective experiment, that is a computer simulation. This present work deals with the systematization and classification of simulation methods in the teaching of natural sciences and mathematics and of production and technology with special retrospective view on computer simulations and exemplar representation of the place and the role of this modern method of cognition. © 2009 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {Many engineering curriculum around the country are re-evaluating their introductory computer programming requirement. At our university, several departments have introduced new computer-based modeling courses that integrate critical thinking and problem solving with computational thinking and programming as a replacement of the traditional first computer programming course. The skills learned in such freshman level courses are being iterated and expanded on in subsequent courses in these curricula in order to create a 'computational thinking thread'. One unforeseen consequence of the computer based modeling course was an increase in the student's problem solving ability. This study explores the role that computing has on student's problem solving abilities and tries to quantify its impact. Students in several freshman and senior level engineering courses across different disciplines were asked to solve a common problem solving task as well as reflect on the process they used to solve the problem. The student's solutions were scored using a protocol based on Wolcott's 'Steps for better thinking rubric' The paper will outline the problem used; report on the scoring procedures and methodology; and present the results from the study. The results demonstrated that students who utilized computing generated better solutions and are better problem solvers than those who did not use a computer. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.}},

We have worked diligently to ensure that students ponder the topics and problems that comprise the material for the course and the material is deeply technical at many levels. We have also pandered to student needs in meeting curriculum requirements, offering the course at a time convenient for athletes and others, and using popular media when possible. We started with the goal of engendering interest and passion for computer science and how it affects the world. We report on our efforts to attain this goal while keeping material appropriately technical.

  abstract = {Intellectual constructs and tools that are widely used to solve the problems of society have been woven into educational programs. For example, the three R's (reading, 'riting & 'rithmetic) are core to a strong fundamental education, and practitioners and researchers routinely apply these tools to their daily work. Computing has become an essential and pervasive problemsolving toolset. This development has fostered much discussion about the role of computing in a modern education, the broadening nature of computing majors and concentrations and their place in post-secondary institutions, for example, [6,7]. Computer science educators recognize the importance of improving information technology (IT) skills and fluency, and a number of studies have developed guidelines on how to do this [3,4]. However, computer science has analytical concepts and tools that offer educational benefits beyond simple IT fluency. Computational thinking was introduced [9] as a continuation of earlier discussions on the nature of computing (e.g. [5]). Similar discussions and the same terminology were introduced independently in a series of workshops and reports [2]. This has helped the computing community to strengthen description and definition of the problem solving skills that computing brings to society, through education, outreach, and research.Over the past few years, computational thinking concepts have served as a basis for several projects, workshops and efforts aimed at more precise, and at the same time, deeper and wider interpretation of computing. This includes attention to K-12 curricula, general education at colleges and universities, as well as interdisciplinary research and technology transfer. This panel will outline a sampling of the activities and projects that have begun to define and address computational thinking. The moderator will start with an outline of national computational thinking activities and developments. The panelists will talk about their individual projects and activities, and outline their visions for future developments in the computing and broader educational communities around computational thinking. The session will then be opened for discussion; the audience will be encouraged to ask questions and contribute ideas for the development of computational thinking across its many dimensions.}},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a model for the generation of ideas within a creative thinking/brainstorming context. In the model, ideas emerge as conceptual combinations from the interaction of complex dynamics at several semantic levels: Features, concepts, categories, and previously generated ideas. This dynamics is shaped by external information on task context, constraints and goals, and is modulated by evaluative feedback from an internal critic working through reinforcement. While the model is abstract, it attempts to capture the interplay between semantic representations in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, working memory in the prefrontal cortex, attentional selection by the basal ganglia, and modulation from the dopaminergic reward system. We show that a context-specific itinerant search for novel but meaningful conceptual combinations (ideas) emerges naturally from the dynamics of this system. We also briefly describe a computational model for ideation in groups using a multiagent formalism. The initial focus of this model is on studying the potential benefits of cognitive diversity in agent groups, e.g., the presence of convergent and divergent thinkers, or agents with different semantic organizations. © 2009 IEEE.}},

Equations play a central role in problem solving across various fields of study. Understanding what an equation means is an essential step toward forming an effective strategy to solve it, and it also lays the foundation for a more successful and fulfilling work experience. Thinking About Equations provides an accessible guide to developing an intuitive understanding of mathematical methods and, at the same time, presents a number of practical mathematical tools for successfully solving problems that arise in engineering and the physical sciences. Equations form the basis for nearly all numerical solutions, and the authors illustrate how a firm understanding of problem solving can lead to improved strategies for computational approaches. Eight succinct chapters provide thorough topical coverage, including: Approximation and estimation Isolating important variables Generalization and special cases Dimensional analysis and scaling Pictorial methods and graphical solutions Symmetry to simplify equations Each chapter contains a general discussion that is integrated with worked-out problems from various fields of study, including physics, engineering, applied mathematics, and physical chemistry. These examples illustrate the mathematical concepts and techniques that are frequently encountered when solving problems. To accelerate learning, the worked example problems are grouped by the equation-related concepts that they illustrate as opposed to subfields within science and mathematics, as in conventional treatments. In addition, each problem is accompanied by a comprehensive solution, explanation, and commentary, and numerous exercises at the end of each chapter provide an opportunity to test comprehension. Requiring only a working knowledge of basic calculus and introductory physics, Thinking About Equations is an excellent supplement for courses in engineering and the physical sciences at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and educators in all branches of engineering, physics, chemistry, biophysics, and other related fields who encounter mathematical problems in their day-to-day work. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Inc..}},

  journal = {Fuzzy Measurement of Sustainability}},
  abstract = {People from many disciplines talk about sustainable development (SD) without having a concrete definition or idea of what it is. Politicians and decision-makers, biologists and environmentalists, engineers and scientists, philosophers and sociologists often mean different things when they mention SD. To take an extreme example, a neoclassical economist might define SD as continual economic growth without regard to the environmental situation, whereas at the other end of the spectrum, a deep ecologist might define it as the preservation and restoration of the ecosystem, ignoring the effect on the economy completely. It has become clear throughout the last few decades leading up to the time this book was written that our society is facing environmental problems of global magnitude such as species extinction, population explosion, global warming, water shortages, exhaustion of fisheries, and deforestation, among others, which have economic and social repercussions. Many people doubt that the world we shall bequeath to our descendants will be all healthy, supportive, and beautiful as the one we inherited from our parents. The fundamental questions then of the SD discussion are: Can we continue our present course without destroying part or most of our environment and society? And if we have to change course (which is currently the consensus opinion) how we do it? This book addresses one of the most fundamental questions of SD: How do we define and measure in the mathematical sense sustainability? In effect it summarizes our research in this field for the last 15 years. The mathematical model which we use to evaluate sustainability serves both as a definition and as a measuring scheme. This is done with the help of fuzzy logic, which is well suited to perform reasoning in fields where concrete mathematical models do not exist and concepts such as sustainability are multifaceted and often subjective. Fuzzy reasoning, in some respects, emulates human thinking and relies on expert opinion and knowledge as well as subjective evaluations. This multistage model is developed step-by-step, in the end providing sustainability assessments of various aspects of a society on a scale from zero to one, such as the environmental or societal situation of a country. All nations of the world for which reliable data exist are then ranked according to their sustainability as measured by the model. A sensitivity analysis reveals the most important components of sustainability for each country. The book is intended for undergraduate students, graduate students, and practitioners working in the field of sustainability. It is based on a course Yannis Phillis has taught at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Technical University of Crete (TUC) at the senior/graduate level.The mathematical knowledge needed to follow the book is minimal and is all contained in the text. Computational guidance is provided for those who would like to write their own model. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {In complex strategic situations decision-making agents interact with many other agents and have access to many pieces of information throughout their play. This usually leads to game solving being a very complex, almost intractable procedure. Moreover, algorithms for solving games usually fail to explain how the various equilibria come about and how "plausible" they are. Reasoning patterns try to capture the strategic thinking of agents and formalize the usage of the various information or evidence they obtain during their interactions. Identifying reasoning patterns can lead to a significant refinement over the full range of equilibria, as well as considerable computational savings in solving the game. Here we present a polynomial-time algorithm that simplifies the original game by iteratively identifying non-effective (ignorable) decision nodes and removing redundant information edges. In some cases, this can lead to exponential-time savings in computing an equilibrium, yet some - potentially efficient-equilibria may be lost in the process. Copyright © 2008.}},

To counter this, we devised a form of structured pseudocode, designed to highlight and facilitate algorithmic construction so that the complexities of the programming language can be deferred until proficiency in design has been reached. Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, students' programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased. Additionally, we found that students appear to strongly prefer such an approach, citing mostly emotive benefits, and that these effects may be particularly strong among women. © 2008 IEEE.}},

And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic.

In this contribution the "picture" concept, which has a long tradition in philosophy, serves as the starting point of an interpretation of the relationship between real systems and theoretical structures of modern science. In addition, the approach dubbed as the "structuralist" approach of scientific theories in the 20th century will be extended and enhanced by the concept of "fuzzy sets" and "fuzzy relations".

The coming of the digital times changes people's life style and thinking modes. The obvious characteristic of digital times is that it leads us into a real virtual world. The spread of mass culture goes along with the spread of mass media. The television, network and computer altogether constructs the virtual space of the times. The times of mass virtual culture is coming. The cognition and emotions of the artists living in the current times changed potentially. The artists eliminate the class gap between serious arts and popular culture through obtaining fashion, consumption, network, animation, and other popular pictures, and change the traditional artistic expressive methods and bring about new characteristics and changes to the works of arts through the borrowing of the inborn sensitivity of the pictures. This article takes the contemporary drawing works as an example to describe how the artists select the inclined theme and contents, and make use of various digital media and the mass popular culture, and form the virtual plots with Chinese contemporarity and rich imagination by the use of game and metaphor. The contemporary drawing works of art used in this paper, unified with the personal experiences of the artists, reflect the virtual plots of the contemporary drawings through the contents of the works, media method and narrative methods. Every history book of arts repeatedly tell us that the formation of any artistic characteristic reflects the situation of politics and economy of that times, and reflects the special states of mind of the artists in that times.

Since this problem tackling is mainly based on simple geometric and algebraic considerations a brief historical summary is given on the antecedents to exemplify the advantages of geometric way of thinking in Natural Sciences. Following that the most popular branches of the classical and novel, Soft Computing (SC) based robust and adaptive approaches are analyzed with especial emphasis on the supposed need and the consequences of obtaining complete, accurate, and permanent models either for the system to be controlled or to the control situation as a whole. Following that, in comparison to the above mentioned more traditional methods, our novel approach is summarized that has the less ambitious goal of obtaining only partial, incomplete, temporal, and situation-dependent models that require continuous refreshment via observing the behavior of the controlled system in the given actual situation. It will be shown how simple geometric considerations can be used for developing a simple iterative learning control for Single Input - Single Output (SISO) systems the conditions of the convergence of which is easy to satisfy by choosing very simple and primitive initial system models and roughly chosen control parameters. Finally it will be shown how the most attractive mathematical properties of the fundamental symmetry groups of Natural Sciences can be utilized for the generalization of our approach to the control of Multiple Input - Multiple Output (MIMO) systems.

  abstract = {Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic logic" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks. © 2007 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {In early phases of design a wide exploration of the design space is crucial to the development of creative solutions. In this regard, Evolutionary Computation (EC), and in particular Genetic Algorithms, contain several qualities that can enhance exploration by opening the search process beyond the focus of finding a single "best" solution. Over the years many researchers in the area of creative thinking including Gordon, de Bono, Parnes, Osborn and others, have suggested design strategies that have interesting parallels in EC processes. For instance, a well known inhibitor of creative thinking is design fixation, where the suggestion of a particular solution makes it difficult to imagine other good solutions. Unlike many other computational search algorithms, EC methods work with populations of "fairly good" solutions. Therefore, there is less danger that creativity will be harmed by design fixation on one "best" solution. This paper shows through a specific example of a truss bridge how an EC based design exploration program can aid the designer by providing a selection of "pretty good" solutions rather than a single optimal solution. Other aspects of the EC program are also discussed including drawbacks to the method such as computational intensity as well as directions of future development.}},

Since we can assume that the most relevant one is linked to the presence of moving foreground objects, their number, their shape, and their appearance can constitute a good mean for content description. For this reason, we propose to combine both motion information and region-based color segmentation to extract moving objects from an MPEG2 compressed video stream starting only considering low-resolution data. This approach, which we refer to as "rough indexing," consists in processing P-frame motion information first, and then in performing I-frame color segmentation. Next, since many details can be lost due to the low-resolution data, to improve the object detection results, a novel spatiotemporal filtering has been developed which is constituted by a quadric surface modeling the object trace along time. This method enables to effectively correct possible former detection errors without heavily increasing the computational effort.}},

Firstly, group argumentation environment (GAE) as a computerized tool is used to facilitate expert divergent thinking process (meeting) on the concerned topics and form scenario or hypotheses based on qualitative MSA. Then, a quantitative evaluation model had been building to analyze the centralization of the different scenarios, which can used to measure the efficient of different argumentation scenario. © 2007 IEEE.}},

The contrasting approaches of a priori rationalism and interactive empiricism in modeling new forms of computational technology that modify historical, philosophical, and mathematical forms of thoughts were explored. The restriction of problem solving to thinking and question answering excludes interactive forms of problem solving that depend on the behavior of the world rather than on a priori human beliefs. The ongoing support for rationalist over empiricist modes of thought suggests that human thinking is inherently more concerned with the rationality of human desires than with the empirical truth of human reasoning.

  abstract = {Dedicated to Gottfried Michael Koenig for his 80th birthday Although Algorithmic composition became popular with the rise of computers, algorithmic thinking is far older – it can be traced back to the ancient times of Pythagoras and the Jewish Kabbalah. It is a method of perceiving an abstract model behind the sensual surface, or in turn, of constructing such a model in order to create aesthetic works. Behind the various approaches there is one common denominator: a longing to create something infinite that exceeds the limited horizon of our individual knowledge. Seen in this light, algorithmic thinking and its application in the arts can become a way to gain experience and to overcome barriers that are either implicit in ourselves, or erected by our social environment. In this article, I am focusing exclusively on the use of algorithms in the compositional process, leaving aside other approaches like the algorithmic simulation of musical styles, the computational modelling of music cognition and the application of artificial intelligence techniques (Cope 1996; Ebcioglu 1990). My primary aim is to demonstrate how the algorithmic spirit has evolved through the centuries – from medieval music theory to the interactive realtime-generated computer music of today. Algorithm The term algorithm was phonetically derived from the name of the Arab mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (ninth century) who introduced Hindu–Arabic numerals and the concepts of algebra into European mathematics. An algorithm can be defined as a predetermined set of instructions for solving a specific problem in a limited number of steps. Algorithms can range from a mere succession of simple arithmetical operations to more complex combinations of procedures, utilising more involved constructions from computer science such as rule-based grammars, recursion and probabilistic inference. © Cambridge University Press 2007.}},

Evaluations showed that users are able to build meaningful vignettes, our tool is easy to learn and fun to use, and our tool's multimedia features are often used and well-liked.

One of the first semiempirical approaches in quantum chemistry was the p-electron method proposed by HUckel (1931) that generates molecular orbitals (MOs) essentially from the connectivity matrix of a molecule and provides valuable qualitative insights into the structure, stability, and spectroscopy of unsaturated molecules. Hoffmann extended this approach to include all valence electrons and applied in many qualitative studies of inorganic and organometallic compounds. These early semiempirical methods had a lasting impact on chemical thinking as they guided the development of qualitative MO theory that is commonly employed for rationalizing chemical phenomena in terms of orbitals interactions. They are normally not used any longer as computational tools. After a survey of the established methods such as MNDO, AM1, and PM3, recent methodological advances are described including the development of improved semiempirical models, new general-purpose and special-purpose parametrizations, and linear scaling approaches. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The conventional box-and-arrow diagram is equally familiar and widespread. Translation between the two throws up a number of interesting challenges. Some of these challenges (such as the relationship between Toulmin warrants and their counterparts in traditional diagrams) represent slightly different ways of looking at old and deep theoretical questions. Others (such as how to allow Toulmin diagrams to be recursive) are diagrammatic versions of questions that have already been addressed in artificial intelligence models of argument. But there are further questions (such as the relationships between refutations, rebuttals and undercutters, and the roles of multiple warrants) that are posed as a specific result of examining the diagram inter-translation problem. These three classes of problems are discussed. To the first class are addressed solutions based on engineering pragmatism; to the second class, are addressed solutions drawn from the appropriate literature; and to the third class, fuller exploration is offered justifying the approaches taken in developing solutions that offer both pragmatic utility and theoretical interest. Finally, these solutions are explored briefly in the context of the Araucaria system, showing the ways in which analysts can tackle arguments either using one diagrammatic style or another, or even a combination of the two. © Springer 2006.}},

  abstract = {Soft computing (SC) is an emerging collection of methodologies which aims to exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth to achieve robustness, tractability, and low total cost. It differs from conventional hard computing (HC) in the sense that, unlike hard computing, it is strongly based on intuition or subjectivity. Therefore, soft computing provides an attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty. Fuzzy logic (FL), neural networks (NN), and genetic algorithms (GA) are the core methodologies of soft computing. However, FL, NN, and GA should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary instead. Considering the number of available journal and conference papers on various combinations of these three methods, it is easy to conclude that the fusion of individual soft computing methodologies has already been advantageous in numerous applications. On the other hand, hard computing solutions are usually more straightforward to analyze; their behavior and stability are more predictable; and, the computational burden of algorithms is typically either low or moderate. These characteristics are particularly important in real-time applications. Thus, it is natural to see SC and HC as potentially complementary methodologies. Novel combinations of different methods are needed when developing high-performance, cost-effective, and safe products for the demanding global market. In this paper, we present an overview of applications in which the fusion of soft computing and hard computing has provided innovative solutions for challenging real-world problems. A carefully selected list of references is considered with evaluative discussions and conclusions.}},

The calculation of building's design cooling load is different from the load analysis of existed buildings, it's a prediction of the maximum possible load of a future building when it is put into use, so it has the character of uncertainty and prediction. In order to improve calculation efficiency and enhance accuracy, expert system technology is introduced and incorporated with load index assessment method. Consequently, expert system for the calculation of building's design cooling load is established on the basis of artificial neural network theories. Application examples indicate that this system is simple and workable; the calculation results thereof achieve high accuracy, and calculation methods are in conformity to the thinking habits of designers.}},

The paper presents a fuzzy-neuro architecture for a computational model, handling the imprecision of human-like thinking on faults and behavior of the conductive flow systems in industry. The primary effects isolation from the secondary effects proceeds in a modular fashion, based on four transport anomalies detected on the flow power disturbance in each (bond graph) junction of interconnected components. The manifestations take a fuzzy representation and the multiple links between manifestations and faults is represented and processed by productive neural networks. The modular structure of the diagnosis system reflects the modular structure of the target system, hence the faults-effects mapping is simpler and the isolation of faults is more precise. © 1999 IEEE.}},

The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems in which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but even to find a good representation for them.

In addition, SC yields rich knowledge representation (symbol and pattern), flexible knowledge acquisition (by machine learning from data and by interviewing experts), and flexible knowledge processing (Inference by interfacing between symbolic and pattern knowledge), which enable intelligent systems to be constructed at low cost [high machine intelligence quotient (HMIQ)]. This paper reviews applications of SC in several industrial fields to show the various innovations by TR, HMIQ, and low cost in industries that have been made possible by the use ofSC.

  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems}},
  abstract = {Distributed Memory MultiComputers (DMMs), such as the IBM SP-2, the Intel Paragon, and the Thinking Machines CM-5, offer significant advantages over shared memory multiprocessors in terms of cost and scalability. Unfortunately, the utilization of all the available computational power in these machines involves a tremendous programming effort on the part of users, which creates a need for sophisticated compiler and run-time support for distributed memory machines. In this paper, we explore a new compiler optimization for regular scientific applications - the simultaneous exploitation of task and data parallelism. Our optimization is implemented as part of the PARADIGM HPF compiler framework we have developed. The intuitive idea behind the optimization is the use of task parallelism to control the degree of data parallelism of individual tasks. The reason this provides increased performance is that data parallelism provides diminishing returns as the number of processors used is increased. By controlling the number of processors used for each data parallel task in an application and by concurrently executing these tasks, we make program execution more efficient and, therefore, faster. A practical implementation of a task and data parallel scheme of execution for an application on a distributed memory multicomputer also involves data redistribution. This data redistribution causes an overhead. However, as our experimental results show, this overhead is not a problem; execution of a program using task and data parallelism together can be significantly faster than its execution using data parallelism alone. This makes our proposed optimization practical and extremely useful. © 1997 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {The High Performance Fortran language is a 'standard by consensus', developed by individuals and vendors in the high performance computing industry, to provide a low barrier entry to parallel computing. It promises to be an easier to use development environment for distributed memory computing platforms compared to the programming complexity required by message passing libraries such as PVM and MPI. HPF promises much and is still in its infancy. Since HPF was developed in part based on experiences gained with early parallel Fortran compilers such as Thinking Machines CM Fortran, we decided to test the effectiveness of HPF with today's generation of HPF compilers by porting a complex existing model code originally developed using CM Fortran. The model code that we selected is a hybrid computational aeroacoustics code that solves the 3D, time-dependent Euler equations in the near flow field and uses a moving surface Kirchhoff's formula to predict the far field sound radiating from turbofan engine inlets. The original CM Fortran model code was developed on a Thinking Machines CM5. The extensive production research use of this model, using varying grid sizes, provides excellent benchmarks with which to compare the HPF port. Two HPF compilers were selected in the porting effort - The Portland Group's (PGI) pghpf and the xlhpf compiler from IBM. IBM's xlhpf does not implement some elements of the HPF subset while PGI's offering provides several full-HPF extensions. porting efforts using each compiler exposed the strengths and weaknesses of each. Porting this complex code exposed many of the growing pains associated with the current generation of compilers. Critical sections of the code will be explained and these critical areas of the conversion effort will be discussed. Where necessary we will demonstrate how different porting strategies affected the performance of the code. Finally we will present how the ported code ran, using a varying number of processors, on an IBM SP2 and an SGI Origin 2000. While the current simple port does not match the speed of a CM-5, we hope further porting efforts and improved compiler technology will enable us to eventually match and then surpass CM-5 performance levels. With the shutdown of the NCSA CM-5 and the eventual removal and failure of the remaining Thinking Machines hardware currently installed, this effort will demonstrate that investments in CM Fortran code need not be abandoned and that new life can be breathed into those dusty decks. © 1997 ACM.}},

The paper focuses on two essential problems; one is the symbol grounding problem and the other is how the internal symbolic processes can be situated with respect to the behavioral contexts. We investigate these problems by applying a dynamical system's approach to the robot navigation learning problem. Our formulation, based on a forward modeling scheme using recurrent neural learning, shows that the robot is capable of learning grammatical structure hidden in the geometry of the workspace from the local sensory inputs through its navigational experiences. Furthermore, the robot is capable of generating diverse action plans to reach an arbitrary goal using the acquired forward model which incorporates chaotic dynamics. The essential claim is that the internal symbolic process, being embedded in the attractor, is grounded since it is self-organized solely through interaction with the physical world. It is also shown that structural stability arises in the interaction between the neural dynamics and the environmental dynamics, which accounts for the situatedness of the internal symbolic process. The experimental results using a mobile robot, equipped with a local sensor consisting of a laser range finder, verify our claims. © 1996 IEEE.}},

  abstract = {We present the results of an architectural comparison of SIMD massive parallelism, as implemented in the Thinking Machines Corp. CM-2, and vector or concurrent-vector processing, as implemented in the Cray Research Inc. Y-MP/8. The comparison is based primarily upon three application codes taken from the LANL CM-2 workload. Tests were run by porting CM Fortran codes to the Y-MP, so that nearly the same level of optimization was obtained on both machines. The results for fully-configured systems, using measured data rather than scaled data from smaller configurations, show that the Y-MP/8 is faster than the 64k CM-2 for all three codes. A simple model that accounts for the relative characteristic computational speeds of the two machines, and reduction in overall CM-2 performance due to communication or SIMD conditional execution, accurately predicts the performance of two of the three codes. Other factors, such as memory bandwidth and compiler effects, are also discussed. Finally, the paper shows the similarity of the CM-2 and Y-MP programming models, and also comments on selected future massively parallel processor designs. © 1992 IEEE.}},

Although these problems are computationally expensive, and so would seem appropriate for parallel machines, their irregular and unpredictable run-time behavior makes this type of parallel program difficult to write and adversely affects run-time performance. This paper explores three issues - partitioning, mutual exclusion, and data transfer - crucial to the efficient execution of irregular problems on distributed-memory machines. Unlike previous work, we studied the same programs running in three alternative systems on the same hardware base (a Thinking Machines CM-5): the CHAOS irregular application library, Transparent Shared Memory (TSM), and extensible Shared Memory (XSM). CHAOS and XSM performed equivalently for all three applications. Both systems were somewhat (13%) to significantly faster (991%) than TSM.}},

On a 256 processor Cray T3D, the implementation outperforms all previous solutions by an order of magnitude. A characterization of graph parameters allows us to select graphs that highlight key performance features. We study the effects of these parameters and machine characteristics on the balance of time between the local and global phases of the algorithm and find that edge density, surface-to-volume ratio, and relative communication cost dominate performance.

A non-conventional variation of a spatio-temporal 3D DWT has been developed in order to analyze motion in time-sequential imagery. The computational complexity of this algorithm is Θ(n3), where n is the number of samples in each dimension of the input image sequence. Methods are needed to increase the speed of these computations for large data sets. Fortunately, wavelet decomposition is very amenable to parallelization. Coarse-grained parallel versions of this process have been design and implemented on three different architectures: a distributed network represented by a distributed network of Sun SPARCstation 2 workstations; two Intel hypercubes (an iPSC/2 and an iPSC/860); and a Thinking Machines Corporation CM-5, a massively parallel SPMD. This non-conventional 3D wavelet decomposition is very suitable for course-grain implementation on parallel computers with proper load balancing. Close to linear speedup over serial implementations has been achieved using a distributed network. Near-linear speedup was obtained on the hypercubes and the CM-5 for a variety of image-processing applications.}},

  abstract = {Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has made tremendous progress especially in aerodynamics and aircraft design over the past 20 years. An obvious question to ask is “why not use CFD methods to solve aeroacoustics problems?”. Most aerodynamics problems are time independent whereas aeroacoustics problems are, by definition, time dependent. The nature, characteristics and objectives of aeroacoustics problems are also quite different from the commonly encountered CFD problems. There are computational issues that are unique to aeroacoustics. For these reasons computational aeroacoustics requires somewhat independent thinking and development. The objectives of this paper are twofold. First, issues pertinent to aeroacoustics that may or may not be relevant to computational aerodynamics are discussed. The second objective is to review computational methods developed recently which are designed especially for computational aeroacoustics applications. Some of the computational methods to be reviewed are quite different from traditional CFD methods. They should be of interest to the CFD and fluid dynamics communities. © 1995 by C.K.W. Tam.}},

  abstract = {We were requested to predict the future specifications of the electronic materials, electronic packages and micro processors for high performance computer systems going as far out as the year 2000 and beyond. These were to be based on the emerging requirements of the end users. Literature and conferences yielded very little quantitative data. As a result, we understood to design and develop a deterministic and macroscopic model based on physics, math, VLSI design, architecture and integration level considerations. The resulting model transcended the electronic world from system performance to microprocessor description to packaging specifications and required materials specifications. Based on this model, it is likely that the world will see an integration of 100 million transistors on a single chip providing clock frequencies approaching 213 MHz and CPU power near about 238 MIPS. Transportation is a major business for Alcoa. We have used our model to examine what architectural directions the Mobile 2000 would take for satisfying its command and control, navigational, entertainment, communication, engine, transmission and body/cockpit control and management systems. A scenario is developed based on the current and emerging requirements for the above functions leading to the automobile of the year 2000. This is then translated to yield control and system requirements which then are converted to the total computational requirements. The requirements are used to define the future system specifications based on our model's predictions. Alternative architectures are then presented. Cautions and caveats are discussed based on our experience on several large scale Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) networks', design development and implementation. It is imperative to bring the large scale systems thinking to Mobile 2000's automation and support systems so that the classical pitfalls of cost, performance, lack of planning, ad hoc and proliferation of incompatible systems does not take place in this exciting arena.}},

  abstract = {This paper examines the processing of visual information beyond the creation of the early representations. A fundamental requirement at this level is the capacity to establish visually abstract shape properties and spatial relations. This capacity plays a major role in object recognition, visually guided manipulation, and more abstract visual thinking. For the human visual system, the perception of spatial properties and relations that are complex from a computational standpoint nevertheless often appears deceivingly immediate and effortless. The proficiency of the human system in analyzing spatial information far surpasses the capacities of current artificial systems. The study of the computations that underlie this competence may therefore lead to the development of new more efficient methods for the spatial analysis of visual information. The perception of abstract shape properties and spatial relations raises fundamental difficulties with major implications for the overall processing of visual information. It will be argued that the computation of spatial relations divides the analysis of visual information into two main stages. The first is the bottom-up creation of certain representations of the visible environment. The second stage involves the application of process called 'visual routines' to the representations constructed in the first stage. These routines can establish properties and relations that cannot be represented explicitly in the initial representations. Visual routines are composed of sequences of elemental operations. Routines for different properties and relations share elemental operations. Using a fixed set of basic operations, the visual system can assemble different routines to extract an unbounded variety of shape properties and spatial relations. © 1984.}},

  title = {The challenges of teaching computer programming}},
  author = {Sleeman D.}},
  year = {1986}},
  journal = {Communications of the ACM}},
  abstract = {Programming has been described by many authors as the new Latin of the school syllabus, a kind of mental whetstone for developing minds. As such, it was assumed that students would develop their general problem-solving skills through learning programming. However, reports from teachers of programming and results from some empirical studies now suggest that the teaching of programming has created significant difficulties for high-school and university students, and has failed to catalyze the development of higher order thinking skills. What has gone wrong?Before reviewing the major points of the three articles that follow, I would like to highlight some of the challenges of both teaching and learning programming. The programmer's objective, for novice and expert alike, is first to specify a detailed plan that can be carried out. That is, the programmer has to decompose the initial task. This is not trivial: Many people are quite unable to say how they perform certain tasks. For instance, many students in introductory programming classes are unable to explain how they are able to select the smallest of a series of integers.Next, the programmer must map this plan into the constructs of the target programming language. There are two points to be made about this mapping process. First, for the process to be “clean,” the programmer needs to have a very clear idea of the abstract plan and of the constructs available in the programming language. One study of novice programmers showed that many novices had very fuzzy notions about a programming language—substantial misunderstandings had occurred with regard to virtually every construct in the language. Second, task decomposition and program coding are not as neatly decoupled as we might think. A simple example: If arrays are not available in the target programming language, then a plan that assumes this capability would be badly flawed. A thorough knowledge of the facilities provided by the programming language is needed even at the stage of formulating the task plan.Debugging a program is similarly complex and demands a variety of skills, including an ability to coordinate information derived from sources such as error messages, the program plan, the program specification, and the actual code.The three articles in this special section address different aspects of the challenge of programming. John Anderson and Edward Skwarecki's “The Automated Tutoring of Introductory Computer Programming” demonstrates that intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) technology can be a more effective way of teaching introductory programming courses—for certain populations. Specifically, the authors discuss the pedagogical effectiveness of a Lisp tutor developed at Carnegie-Mellon University.Elliot Soloway's “Learning to Program = Learning to Construct Mechanisms and Explanations” challenges conventional wisdom by taking a fresh look at assumptions about the art of programming. Soloway advocates a more explicit approach to the teaching of problem-solving skills, which is based on the actual skills experienced programmers use in addressing real tasks. Recent experiments have suggested that the domain knowledge of experienced programmers is organized in a radically different way from the domain knowledge of novices; analogous results have also been reported for chess and music. In all cases, experts use larger chunks of knowledge. An important instructional question is how to bring novices up to the expert's level of domain knowledge.Aside from teaching details of the syntax and semantics of a particular programming language, Soloway argues, it is necessary to explicitly and concurrently explain why and how programs work, the goal of any given program, what plan segments are, strategies for decomposing tasks, rules that well-formed programs adhere to, and design strategies. If followed, this approach would produce several radically different types of programming courses.”Boxer: A Reconstructible Computational Medium,” by Andrea A. diSessa and Harold Abelson, proposes a radically new kind of computational medium—one that would be highly tailorable, and able to accommodate a wide range of users, from a seven-year-old to an experienced nonprofessional. The authors suggest that students’ difficulties may have more to do with the nature of programming than with teaching per se. They describe their current project, Boxer, which is an attempt to provide an environment for a wide spectrum of human activities. The central notion of Boxer is the metaphor of nested “boxes” organized in a hierarchy that gives novices access to explicit and detailed information about the computer environment, but allows proficient programmers to work at the highly abstract and implicit level that is natural to them.All three articles emphasize the need for sensitive experimentation for determining the effectiveness of innovative approaches to the teaching of programming. In the absence of strong and pervasive cognitive theories, it is important to carry out extensive evaluations of all such innovative approaches. We must find out from experience whether well-structured ICAI can be as useful and important as Anderson and Skwarecki suggest; or how we might be able to teach Soloway's high-level problem-solving skills effectively through programming; or how well seven-year-olds will be able to get along with the Boxer system, and for what range of tasks. Any mismatches between observations and expectations will hopefully suggest the next round of new languages and environments, and in turn motivate the next set of observations. © 1986, ACM.

To this end, a study was designed in which two groups of students took Test Q; one group using calculators to eliminate the need for computation, and the other just using paper and pencil to solve the problems. It was found that after controlling for differences in mathematical ability, the two groups did not differ in their scores on Test Q.
